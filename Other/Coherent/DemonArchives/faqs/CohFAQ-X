At present, Coherent supports X only as a client/server on the host machine.
ie. you cannot serve clients over a network, since there is no networking
support.

This was a problem with Xfree , it happened in Linux also, i think it was not
saving the text video screen properly, or something like that.

sorry, i had to reboot to get out of this problem.  Good LUck!

Subject: ATI Graphics Ultra Timings

I sent a message to mwcbbs!support about the timings for an ATI Graphics
Ultra Plus/Pro.  The timings that I sent work with my NEC SVGA monitor.  They
might work with other NEC monitors as well.  I cannot validate this.  I
notified fred@lepanto.mwc.com of my posting so that the message doesn't sit
at the bottom of a heap of other mail messages.  Unfortunately, I don't
currently have them, so I am unable to post the timings.  I derived the
timings by following the instructions that MWC posted.  The instructions
are also in /usr/X11/doc for those with 4.2/X.  I'm happy to say that the
timings that I derived work. If MWC hasn't posted what I sent to them by
tomorrow, I will post them myself.  Keep in mind that the timings may not
work if you have a different monitor.  However, I have a SVGA monitor, so
if your monitor is SVGA-compatible then they should work.  Good luck!

Subject: Video doen't work.. even vga2!
Keywords: ati, oak, vga2, Xwindows
Summary: vga card doesn't cooperate in X

I'd hate to post so many newbie questions, but I feel cornered...

Tried to hook up X under Coh 4.2 again last night.  No good.
I called MWC support, and the guy on the other end went through the
standard questions..  RAM?  Resolution?  Number of disks installed from
the X package?  I finally forwarded my Xconfig and the nohup.out

Well the final verdict was that the oak card was no good.  I asked if
there was any card that was recommended as compatible now, and useful for
future releases.  ATI "mach 32" cards wre the answer.

After fussing around with files for a while longer I ran out to the store
and _bought_ this (300.00) card.  Just had to see if I could get X to run
(it crashes).  Well I reached a point where it _might_ not crash totally,
just halt stuff for a while.  The message back would be about trying to
get X up, after 70 of so trys, and failing.  It varies a bit though,
sometimes the system doesn't come back, so I reboot.

Also, the autodetect did not like the ati Graphics Ultra+, this caused the
system to lock as well (so I reinstalled).

Question(s):

If the Oak is so bad (is it?) what's a safe bet card (under $300.00)?  I'd
replace it (if I had to) with a clone for +- $130.00, but I want to return
the ati.

Could anyone spell out a methodical approach here to get the problem
narrowed down.  I'd settle for CGA resolution (that's a joke for all you
multisync snobs) if I could only see that X could find the mouse, and the
board.

Believe me,  I went through that Xconfig file, and rem'ed out a bit of stuff.
I'd email whatever files I can redirect during startx, or X -probeonly, or
whatever else I can use.

Thanks,






Allan

Subject: NEC 3Ds & ATI Vantage

I'm STILL trying to get X windows to work in color. I have a ATI Vantage
graphics card and an NEC3Ds monitor. After reading all the available info I'm
beginning to understand my situation but I wanted to confirm.  My card only
has 512 M of VGA memory but 1024 if the accelerator chip is used. I believe
in VGA mode, the accelerator card is not used, so does this mean I can only
use my card at 512M? It seems to me that this is false since I've been able to
configure my card in Windows to use SVGA. The ATI people said that the only
way the accelerator chips are used is in 8514/a mode. Does this make sense?

Now for my X question. I've tried quite a few different setting of the clocks
but none have yet to work in color mode. I ran X386 -probe (or whatever that
was) and the outsput shows the clocks as 1 2 3 4 ... 16. I expected some more
interesting numbers. Am I doing something wrong? I was also curious if anyone
has tried the manual clock setting using my configuration. I've ran through
the process myself, but a lot of the information I need doesn't seem to be
in my manual. Specifically the DCF of my video card. Does anyone have at least
this information for this type of card? I'll be faxing a request to ATI soon,
but I thought this might be faster. I am using:
chipset "ati"
videoRAM 1024
and the system does seem to realize that I'm using the 28800 chipset, but it
seems to think that my card is a ATI Wonder Plus.

Thanks,
Scott

Here is the real clocks for the Ultra Card running under CohX i used these so
i know they work for me!
Good luck!
Clocks  18 22 35 28 36 44 50 56
        30 32 37 39 40  0 75 65


These clocks are for the ati wonder compatibility mode, ie the same clocks used
for the wonder card.  These should work if not email me.!

If it helps this is the mode for 8415/a compatibility it is not to bad on my
moniter.

"1024x768"    44.9  1024 1048 1208 1264   768  776  784  817   Interlace

44.9 is the dot-clock, i dont know what would be the equivilant in the ET4000

All true I'm afraid.  Take a look at your card.  You only have 512k for VGA.
I have an older Graphics Ultra (Mach 8), and I'm in the same boat.  Your
options are: 1) live with it; 2) buy a new video card; 3) port XFree 2.0,
which does support the Mach 8 (and presumably the 1024k it has available to
it).

Try the following entries (sent to me by Bill Richardson -- thanks Bill!)

Clocks  18 22 35 28 36 44 50 56
        30 32 37 39 40  0 75 65

ModeDB
#            clock  horizontal timing        virtical timing
"800x600"       32   776  776  896  968     585  634  637  646


You may have to play with the ModeDB to get satisfactory results with
your monitor.

For the ATI Graphics Ultra Plus/Pro, the default Coherent/X timings for
"800x600" and "640x480" already work.  However, the timings for "1024x768"
do not.  Here is the information that you need in your Xconfig for Coherent/X
to work with your ATI Graphics Ultra in "1024x768" mode as well.


        chipset "ati"
        videoRAM 1024k
        Modes "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
        Clocks 18 22 25 28 36 44 50 56 30 32 37 39 40 0 75 65
        Virtual 1024 768

        # ATI Graphics Ultra Plus/Pro/60 Hz/Non-Interlaced

        #Mode           horizontal timings      vertical timings
        "1024x768"      65 1024 1120 1264 1360  768 771 778 825

I prefer non-interlaced at 60 Hz over Interlaced at 87 Hz.  I have an NEC monitor
and it looks good at 60 Hz.

Also, you must set the "VGA Memory Size" of your Graphics Ultra Plus/Pro to
"1.0MB".  To do this, run the ATI "Install" utility and select the
"Set Power-Up Configuration" option; then select the "VGA Memory Size" option
and choose "1.0MB".  Escape from the menus and save the configuration; then
reboot into Coherent.  Good luck!

I have an NEC SVGA monitor which supports 1024x768 NI at 60 Hz and 1024x768
Interlaced at 87 Hz.  If your monitor supports non-interlaced mode at 60 Hz,
I suggest that you use it.  Interlaced mode, as you now know, is bothersome.
