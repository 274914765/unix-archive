This is the Frequently (occassionally)
Asked Questions posting for comp.os.coherent,
with answers about the COHERENT operating system, V3.2.  It
is also posted on comp.os.coherent, but it is not a full FAQ for
comp.os.coherent.  Companion postings have answers that apply to both
Version 4.0 and 4.2.nn and answers that apply to 4.2.05 and X11 alone.

Some general notes:

When used alone, the word "Coherent" is used to mean any of the
versions that may have been released.

Unless otherwise specified, these answers refer to COHERENT.3.2, which
is the oldest release still seemingly still in use.

Many people have contributed to this list, directly or indirectly.  In
some cases, an answer has been adapted from one or more postings on the
comp.os.coherent newsgroup.  Our thanks to all of those who post answers.

T E C H N I C A L  T I P S :
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1.
MODEM DEVICES:

Q: What devices should I use with a modem for dialing in / dialing out

A: For dialing in you should use a device with modem control. For example
   com1r or com2r. That is important to ensure that when the calling site
   dropped carrier, that also at your site SIGHUP is sent to already running
   processes, to ensure that the modem hangs up (dropping DTR) and a new
   getty is opened on that port to enable further logins.

   For dialing out or local terminals you do not need modem control 
   Also you do not have to worry about cabling problems, just use some
   of those null modem cables available in most computer stores.

Q2.
REMOTE LOGINS:
Q:  How do I enable logins via modem to my machine:

A:  I assume that modem is set to AUTO-ANSWER (ATS0=1) and the cabling
    is ok.
    Edit the file  /etc/ttys. Here an example for com2:
    
    0rPcom2r
  
    0            = not yet enabled (enable = allow login, run getty)
 
    r            = remote access   (will enable asking of a password
                                    for remote-access (see /etc/passwd)
                   Why ? System security, additional password

    P            = speed (your modem is connected to the computer)
                   P = 9600 Baud, I use this for my Telebit Modem
       
    com2r        = device with modem control, when CARRIER is lost it
                   will sent SIGHUP to all processes running on that
                   line and will also drop DTR so a modem hangup or 
                   a modern modem does a hardware reset.

     Now type the following:
     enable com2r    (for Coherent 3.2 that's enough)
     kill -1 1       (Coherent 3.0.0 or 3.1.0, Process INIT will start
                      a getty on com2r)


Q3.
FAST MODEMS:
Q:    Can I use fast modems with Coherent ?

A:    Yes you can. But you must think about the following:

      a) maximum  Baud rate between modem - machine is 9600 Baud
         (Coherent as a multiuser/multitasking environment is
          not fast enough for 19200 Baud)

      b) cps-rates in transfer depend on modem/method

         calling into my machine (T2500) with a USR, using sz for transfer:
                   480 cps to 600 cps (compressed, uncompressed files)

         calling out with uucp (T2500):
                   860 cps

         The rate may differ if you use a slow 286 or 386. The above results
         were yielded with a 386/33.


Q4.
SIMULTANEOUS USERS:
Q:    I want to use Coherent as a multiuser operating system. How many
      users can work with it at the same time ?

A:    Now 11 User:
      console   : 1
      com1      : 1
      com2      : 1
      Multiport : 8
      --------------
                 11

      I still do not know if there are device drivers for intelligent
      Multiport-Cards but as far as I know there are only drivers for
      "dumb" Multiport-Cards and only in polled mode.
      Therefore you need a very fast machine for "multiuser"


Q5.
USENET NEWS SOFTWARE:
Q:    Is there any Net-News Software for Coherent ?

A:    Yes, there are several packages available:

      1. CNEWS  -  the famous package

         difficult to install (although there is a nice installation
         script in the Coherent version). Only for advanced users !
         Has no reader !

      2. WNEWS 3.0  -  News for MINIX, ported to Coherent

         based on BNEWS - small, not bad
         Has no reader

      3.  GNEWS 2.0 (or newer now ?)
 
         all you need for News, easy to install, Newsreader, nice

      4.  rn

          the well known newsreader

      5.  tass 
      
            curses based newsreader. Nice, but you should not have
            too much groups or articles in /usr/spool/news.

      6.  bsnews
 
          small news package for receiving news via email


Q6.
EMAIL PACKAGES:
Q:    I do not like Coherent's mailer. What can I use instead of it ?

A:    WMAIL 3.63  -  a minix port, MAILX-clone

      comb 1.29   -  curses based mailer, nice interface

      You should ensure that in both cases you have smail 2.5 as
      a smart-mailer that understands domain addresses.
      smail 2.5 is already in Coherent 3.2

Q7.
THE 64K QUESTION:
Q:    Does Coherent really have a 64 kb limitation ? I want to port
      the GNU-C-Compiler and compile big programs.

A:    Coherent programs are limited to 64 K for code and 64 k for data
      and stack. The limit is not in the compiler, it's in the kernel
      or at least in the actual system design. No process can exceed this
      limitation.
      But Binaries in Coherent are about 40 % smaller so big programs
      for "Real-UNIXES" may also be portable

Q8.
COMPILER HINTS:
Q:    I write a C-program that seems to be ok but it still core dumped.
      Is this a compiler error ? Is my program wrong ?

A:    If a program needs a lot of space for local data (resided on the
      stack in most cases) then the maximum size for the stack may be
      exceeded and your return addresses or other important things were
      overwritten.
      With the program fixstack you can increase the size for the stack
      (and also cut the space for data)
      Try size my_prog before and after fixstacking to see the difference.

Q9.
HARDWARE CONFIGURATIONS:
Q:     What hardware (Motherboard, hard disk) do I need for Coherent ?

A:     Difficult question. Minimum is a AT 286 with 640 KB RAM and a
       hard disk (MFM,RLL,ESDI,SCSI (some), IDE (some)) with at least
       10 MB free disk space.

       Nevertheless Coherent is not the fastest operating system, so
       a 386 with at least 25 MHZ and 4 MB RAM and a fast hard disk
       (a hard disk is always too small !!!!) is the minimum config-
       uration for a usable multi-user-operating.

Q10.
TERMIO HINTS:
Q:    I compiled a program that uses termio but it did not work.

A:    The termio in Coherent (at least 3.1.0 and the first 3.2.0) did
      not work in all cases. So try the sgtty, that works fine.
      When porting programs try to find the -DBSD-parts. There you will
      find in most cases the sgtty-parts you need for porting.

Q11.
CURSES:
Q:    I compiled a program that uses curses but the screen sometimes get
      garbled or the machine seems to hang

A:    Maybe you still have an old libcurses.a. Replace it with a newer
      copy.

Q12.
MORE UUCP:
Q:    I often loose email or files after receiving them with UUCP.

A:    Try to get the newest UUCP-update from MWCBBS. The old packages
      still have some problems. Check the permissions, at least for example
      with comparing them with those on your original diskettes.
      Check also the permissions of the needed directories.
      In /usr/spool/uucp/Logs./uucp-program you will find the "hints" of the
      "uucp-program" (uucico, uucp, uux,uuxqt) what goes wrong.
      In Coherent 3.2. you have the program uucheck that will check your
      uucp-installation and is also able to "fix" problems. But you have to
      run it twice if you run it as root because the first time it creates
      the needed directories and the second run sets the correct permission.

Q:    I am having a problem connecting to uucp sites not running Coherent 
      after updating to Coherent 3.2.  The error looks like a parity 
      problem, with an {expect} / {actually got} output like: 
	uu315323t 342og310n:   (With backslashes before the numbers)

A:      Again, get the latest UUCP package from MWCBBS.  The 3.2 Coherent 
      release may exhibit a parity problem which is cured with the latest 
      uucp release.

Q13.
HOW TO CREATE A BOOTABLE >>>R/W<<< FLOPPY from Coherent
	From: Peter Fillingham 	fillingham@att.com

The COHERENT Operating System Release Notes (Release 3.1.0)
along with the main manual suggest ways of creating a bootable
floppy.  One difficulty of this procedure is that, after 
producing a bootable floppy, one can't write to it !
The following shell programs are suggested as a way making a
bootable floppy, and below is the fix recommended by mwc
for making the bootable floppy system read-write.


(0) first boot your system from your hard disk, login in as root,
use mkdir to make a convenient subdirectory [e.g., /bin/temp ]. 
cd to /bin/temp. Place disk #1 of your mwc original floppies in 
drive A:, then enter


dd if=/dev/fha0 of=cohboot count=80 bs=30b

Run it in the background if you wish [follow the above line with 
an &; use ps -axfl if you are curious].  This will take just over 
three minutes depending on the speed of your system.  What is
going on is that dd is creating an image of your boot floppy in
you default directory with the file name cohboot. When it finishes,
remove the mwc original floppy, and insert a blank disk.


(1) Next run the following shell program:


echo "/etc/fdformat -v /dev/fha0"
/etc/fdformat -v /dev/fha0
echo "/etc/badscan -o proto /dev/fha0 2400"
/etc/badscan -o proto /dev/fha0 2400



Run it in the background if you wish; it takes time.
The echo lines simply display each command line just before it is
carried out to tell you what is going on. The second and fourth
lines format the floppy and check for bad blocks, respectively.
In addition, a file (proto) is being built in your default
subdirectory.  This file will contain a list of the bad blocks:
look for a line with %b in it. Probably it is best to use only
a floppy with NO bad blocks: so try until you find one.


(2) make sure you have a subdirectory /f0 on your hard disk;

if not, use mkdir /f0.

(3) Next run the following shell program:


echo "/etc/mkfs /dev/fha0 proto"
/etc/mkfs /dev/fha0 proto
echo "cp /conf/boot.fha /dev/fha0"
cp /conf/boot.fha /dev/fha0
echo "dd if=cohboot of=/dev/fha0 count=80 bs=30b"
dd if=cohboot of=/dev/fha0 count=80 bs=30b
echo "/etc/mount /dev/fha0 /f0"
/etc/mount /dev/fha0 /f0
echo "cd /f0 "
cd /f0 
echo "^G DONE but f0 still mounted !"



The second line produces the file system on the floppy using the 
information from file proto.  The fourth line copies boot.fha
to the floppy.  The sixth line transfers the image of your
system boot floppy to your newly formatted disk (note all
these things take time). Finally, the floppy is mounted so that
while you have booted from the hard disk and have root permissions
you can write to the floppy. The last line simply rings the bell
and tells you it is done.


(4) next (noting that your default directory is /f0, i.e. the

  floppy disk) enter:
  
  mv begin autoboot
	then enter
  db coherent
	then enter
  ronflag
	the response is
  ronflag=001
	then enter
  .=0
	then a response appears
  ronflag=000
	then enter
  :q
	and you should get back your prompt.




(5) Finally while the floppy is still mounted, cp over your most useful
programs to the appropriate directories (e.g., vi or me, du, df ...)
Lastly umount f0, shutdown, sync and boot your writable floppy.



Q14.
MASTER BOOT REINSTALLATION:
	From: doug@mwc.com (Doug Peterson)
I want to upgrade the DOS partition from MS-DOS 3.3 to 5.0, and the 
installation program refuses to work with the Coherent master bootstrap
program. It no longer asks for the ability to boot Coherent!

The problem specifically is caused be Microsoft's faulty update install
procedure. They assume you have no other operating system on the 
computer.

When the 5.0 update install is run, the procedure archives the original
master boot block of the hard drive and rewrites a brand new one. 
Problem is, it takes Coherent's master boot along with it. To restore 
the master boot is very simple:

Use dos 5.0 fdisk to change the active partition to COHERENT. Reboot.

Use COHERENT's fdisk utility with the -b option to rewrite a new master
boot. Specifically; fdisk -b /conf/mboot /dev/at0x <ENTER>

Once completed, you can now boot either system no matter which one is 
active or inactive.



Q15.
LINE PRINTER HELP: From: dave@uvm-gen!pete (Dave Peterson)
I have my printer hooked up to lpt1 and cannot get any output.  I have 
checked my files, but, no luck.  What's the problem?

1) ls -li   ( The i will list the inode number, this will tell you where
              you have linked /dev/lp to. )

2) ln -f /dev/lpt2 /dev/lp  ( link to lpt2  IBM and MWC number the ports 
                           differently thus lpt2 is the first printer )
                           [ you need to be root or bin to do the link ]
						    
This is a partial listing of my /dev directory note the first number is
the inode number.  I have linked lp to lpt2.
  174 c-w--w--w-  2 bin        bin          3   1 Mon Nov 25 17:36 /dev/lp
  101 c-w--w--w-  1 bin        bin          3   0 Fri Apr 27  1990 /dev/lpt1
  174 c-w--w--w-  2 bin        bin          3   1 Mon Nov 25 17:36 /dev/lpt2
  173 c-w--w--w-  1 bin        bin          3   2 Fri Apr 27  1990 /dev/lpt3

As a final point when you send data to /dev/lpt2 use pipes not redirection.
Try cat (file) | /dev/lpt2  it works for me.


Q16.
MOVING DATA FROM A SUN TO COHERENT:
		(From: PINEAU@uqac.uquebec.ca (Louis Pineau))

First, the floppy have to be formatted whether on the sun or on the
Coherent system (with fdformat /dev/rfd0c on the sun). Once the floppy
is formatted, there is no need to reformat or mkfs it for the life of the
floppy or until something unusual happens.

To write and read the floppy, on both system (sun and coherent), I use the
command "ustar" since it can handle multi-volume files (files that are too
large to fit on a single floppy).


Thus, on the sun, I do:
  /usr/5bin/ustar -cvf /dev/rfd0c file [files ...]    to write on the floppy
  /usr/5bin/ustar -tvf /dev/rfd0c                     to list the floppy
  /usr/5bin/ustar -xvf /dev/rfd0c [file ...]          to read the floppy


On my coherent system, I use the same commands without the /usr/5bin prefix
and with the proper floppy device (/dev/fva1 on my system).

I know that there is a way to read or write ms-dos formatted floppy but in
order to mount or unmount the floppy, you must become superuser.



Q17.
MULTI-VOLUME ARCHIVE: (From: jr@connie.de.convex.com (Joachim Riedel))

I'm trying to archive a 5 mb file (which is itself a compressed cpio file)
from hard disk onto floppy disk (fva1). I've tried cpio and tar and even pax
directly but cannot get past one volume. 

Use the raw device (i.e. /dev/rfva1 ) instead of the device  fva1.

Q18.
SCSI MKFS NOTES: Answer From: stephen@mwc.com (Stephen Davis)

I am trying to add a second scsi drive to my system.  mkfs will not accept 
a proto file.  What do I do?

You do not badscan a SCSI drive. Instead of giving mkfs a proto file, you give
it the total number of blocks in the partition. The number of blocks is listed
in the partition table under f-disk.



Q19.
DOS TO COHERENT:
Q: The question is, is it possible to read DOS-format 360KB-diskettes?

A: yes it is :-)   From: lvds@tfpbbs.uucp (Laurent Cas)

Here is the device type reference table:
Device name  Sectors/track  Heads  Sectors  Bytes   Format
/dev/f9a0          9          2      720    360 KB   5.25"
/dev/fqa0          9          2     1440    720 KB   3.5"
/dev/fha0         15          2     2400    1.2 MB   5.25"
/dev/fva0         18          2     2880    1.44 MB  3.5"


If your 360KB drive is 'A:' (MSDOS reference) you can do dos t /dev/f9a0
to list your disk, or if your 360KB is 'B:' you will have to do dos t /dev/f9a1

drive A is number 0 and drive B is number 1 ; same for partitions on your
hard disk...


Cheers, Laurent.


Q20.
UUINSTALL BUG HELP: (From norm@mwc.com)

Using Coherent 3.2, I run UUINSTALL, upon exiting, I am back at my 
prompt, but, the system hangs. the only way to restart via a reboot.
Is this problem specific to 3.2 or is it something I have possibly done?

This is a bug in the 3.2.0 release of uuinstall. Occasionally, upon exiting,
it leaves your terminal in "raw" mode.  The Errata sheet which is included
with 3.2 releases mentions this, as far as I know.  To fix your terminal
after exiting uuinstall, enter the following (note that <ctrl-J> is the control
key plus the letter J):


	<ctrl-J> stty sane <ctrl-J>


Q21.
XWINDOWS:  (From doug@mwc:)

From time to time, we get people asking about X windows on Coherent. Many new
entrants into the field of UNIX have probably heard of the popular UNIX
graphics interface called X-WINDOWS.

X-WINDOWS was developed by MIT. To the best of our knowledge they still hold
the rights to the source code and it is in the public domain.

To the best of our knowledge, the source code takes up 110mb of disk space!
The binaries, an additional 12 - 20mb's of disk space. It requires TCP or
Streams support, neither of which is in COHERENT.

X-windows it seems, has become somewhat of a popular GUI for
UNIX in a very short time. Various hardware firms have developed and are
marketing X-workstations, servers and cards.

On page 14 of the November 1991 issue of UNIX REVIEW, is an ad for
X11 Release 5 for System V/386. The price advertised is $495 with printed
manuals, $395 without. So, X is not cheap via the commercial route.

Given COHERENT'S small model compiler, it is obviously impossible at this
time for COHERENT to even compile the code, let alone run it. COHERENT 386,
currently undergoing intensive development, will feature a 32-bit native
mode compiler.

At this time, we don't envision COHERENT ever shipping with X-Windows
given the fact that the size of it would double the size of COHERENT
overnight.


Q22.
TAR HELP:

The Coherent version of tar has been known to create problems for users.
It is believed that the latest version of tar has alleviated most of these
problems. Some of the original problems include inability to read a tar archive
to tar creating recursive inode/file loops that can only be removed by
"clri".  The more recent Coherent releases also includes ustar, which 
appears to be much more robust.  It has been suggested to use the ustar
command instead of the Coherent native tar command in most cases.


Q23.
SETTING BOOT PARTITION: DOS or Coherent?

Occasionally, a user may want to boot to Coherent for the most part, rather
than come up in DOS by default.  You can leave the DOS partition in tact,
and switch between the preferred operating systems on as "as needed" basis.
To do this, simply use the fdisk program in either operating system and 
make the partition active for the operating system that resides there. Reboot
the system, (AMI Bios system owners require a hard reset) and the system will
now boot to the partition made active with fdisk. For example, if you wish
to boot DOS by default, make the first partition active.  If you want to boot
Coherent by default, make the partition active that Coherent resides on.

Q24.
A BACKUP SCRIPT:   From udo@umunk.gun.de Thu Aug 20 07:58:16 1992

	[ This script was Written by Udo Munk, a name you will see thoughout 
	the Coherent 4.0 manual.  Udo has ported a *lot* of software to
	Coherent, and following is a backup script Udo sent me some time
	ago.  I am very appreciative of his efforts, he has made a very
	positive difference in the quality of software available for 
	Coherent, as well as many features used in Coherent, (terminfo and
	tic just to name two).  I wish I could contribute so much!
