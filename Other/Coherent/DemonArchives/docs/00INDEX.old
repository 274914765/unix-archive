Files with extension .Z are compressed with *-b16* to reduce disk space
and transfer times!

If you run COHERENT 3.x:
To uncompress be sure, that you have increased the size of the ram1 device
to 640kb (see your COHERENT documentation)! Please be *patient* while
uncompressing, it needs much more time then files compressed with -b12.

Files with extension .z are compressed with gzip, a port for COHERENT 4.0
is available in the cohsrc directory.
