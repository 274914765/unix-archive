I have no idea what versions are what here. Each directory is an
archive which was sent to me, or which I found on the 'net. Any
help in sorting this out would be much appreciated!

Coherent1	comes from http://ftp.mayn.de/pub/coherent
Coherent2	comes from ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk/pub/coherent/
Coherent3	comes from Ryan M.Blair <blairrya@msu.edu>
Coherent4	comes from Paul Ward <asmodai@ao.mine.nu>

  pleads amnesia.I grabbed a copy of mayn's coherent tree last April,
  some 2GB tgz'd.  This is the complete Coherent installation, in form
  of a copy of .dd floppy images, and some additional pieces.
  Unfortunately I don't have any FTP server set up anywhere, so do you,
  by chance, have a place where I can drop it off?

I don't have 2G of spare disk space :-)
