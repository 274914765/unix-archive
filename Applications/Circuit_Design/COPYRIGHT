Subject: Re: Steve Bourne's UNIX Circuit Design System - Draw

Hi Clem,

I consulted with the folks here who setup the "Ancient UNIX
Source" license and it appears perfectly acceptible to simply
include the Draw package under this umbrella. The relevant
portion of the license is as follows:

   "The SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS to which SCO grants rights under this
    AGREEMENT are restricted to the following UNIX Operating Systems, including
    SUCCESSOR OPERATING SYSTEMs, that operate on the 16-Bit PDP-11 CPU and
    early versions of the 32-Bit UNIX Operating System with specific exclusion
    of UNIX System V and successor operating systems:
        16-Bit UNIX Editions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 32-bit 32V"

So, i would suggest sending Warren Toomey (wkt@cs.adfa.edu.au)
the source code for the most recent Draw package which you can
retrieve (and which is included in one of the above UNIX Editions).

Warren, is this acceptable to you or do we need to do anything more
formal ? In our opinion, the Draw package was part of the already released
editions and was late in delivery to you.

Clem, congratulations on successfully reading a nearly 20 year old
9-track tape !
