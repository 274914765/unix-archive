Version 2.0 of p11 - the Begemot PDP-11 emulator - is available on
ftp.fokus.gmd.de:/pub/nthp/11. This release supports the following
platforms:

	BSD/386 1.1	x86
	SunOS 4.1.3	SPARC
	Solaris 2.x	SPARC
	DEC/OSF1 T3.2	ALPHA

The distribution consists of both source and binary kits. In addition,
for those of you not being fortunate to have bootable RL02 disk images,
a demo version of the emulator is run on the ftp server. Try one of the
following

	telnet ftp.fokus.gmd.de 10000
	telnet ftp.fokus.gmd.de 10001
	telnet ftp.fokus.gmd.de 10002
	telnet ftp.fokus.gmd.de 10003

to get connected to one of the four available terminals. If telnet
connects, but this terminal is currently in use, you'll get a short
message. You should then try connecting to another port. Once you are
online, log into RSX-11M with

	hel guest/

(no password necessary). Don't forget to say "bye", before disconnecting
with telnet.

The current implementation emulates a KDJ11A with 1MByte of RAM, one or
more RLV12 disk controllers, a boot ROM, one or more KL11A controllers
and a standard line printer interface. While emulation speed has not
been fully evaluated yet, the integer performance on high-end workstations
seems comparable to the real KDJ11A. DMA performace peeks at nearly twice
the speed of the real machine.

Enjoy,
