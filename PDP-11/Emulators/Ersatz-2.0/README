This directory contains a demo version of the Ersatz-11 PDP-11 simulator for
PCs running DOS, by John Wilson.  Note that HD.SYS has changed since V1.1A,
so you must install the new HD.* files when upgrading to V2.x.

Files:

install.exe	self-installing archive of Ersatz-11 V2.2 Demo
e11demo.ps	Postscript version of the Adobe Acrobat documentation
		file contained in install.exe

fuzzball	subdirectory containing an experimental bootable Fuzzball pack

lunar		subdirectory with VT11 lunar lander program by Jack Burness

At the moment there is no plain text version of the E11 documentation file.
If printing it out is impossible or undesirable, PC users can see e11demo.ps
using Ghostscript, there's a version precompiled for DOS and/or Windows
available for free download on prep.ai.mit.edu in the pub/gnu directory.
