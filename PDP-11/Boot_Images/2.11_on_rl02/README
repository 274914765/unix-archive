Short help to run 211BSD in Bob Supnik's PDP simulator v2.2
-----------------------------------------------------------

Please take notice of the copyrights for 211BSD and the simulator.

Howto run 211BSD
----------------
- Get all files from this directory.
- gunzip the 211*.gz files
- Create a subdirectory emu, and unpack the file pdpsim.tz in this directory.
- Run patch to apply the file 'patches' to the simulator sources
- Run 'make pdp11'
- copy the executable 'pdp11' into your search-path
- Run 'pdp11 script'. The scriptfile will initialize the simulated disks
  and boot from rl0. Just press return to boot the unix-kernel.

Remarks
-------
- Some executables still don't run. Unfortunately 'vi' is one of them.
  use ed instead. (for the time being).
- The package is installed on 4 RL02 and 6 RK05 drives. I used a lot
  of symlinks to get it working. The directory /usr/ingres and the 
  web files in /usr/dict are compressed to make it fit.
- Don't run fsck on the raw (/dev/rrk?h) devices. For some reason 
  the kernel panics on this.
- The machine's hostname is 'elfje'. It is a little dutch pun:
  the dutch word 'elf' means 'eleven'. ('elfje' means 'little elf')
- The package includes all binaries, include files and kernel sources.
  The generated kernel is generated from /sys/SYSTEM.

Happy hacking. Franc
