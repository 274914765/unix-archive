The directories here contain `exploded' UNIX distributions, so that you can
access individual files easily. This saves you from having to extract them
from the original distribution. However, in some instances files and
directories have had their permissions changed, to allow browsing regardless
of user-id or group-id. File ownership has been kept intact in the on-line
version, but may have default values on a CD-ROM distribution. Consult the
original distribution for correct permissions.

V6 comes from the files in Distributions/research/Dennis_v6
V7 comes from the files in Distributions/research/Henry_v7
2.11BSD comes from the files in Distributions/ucb/2.11BSD

The V7 directory has been modified to include the vt client used by the
virtual tape server in Tools/Tapes/Vtserver.
