lint vs static
With two C files like this:

file1.c:
	static int stringscan()
	{ return 1; }

file2.c:
	static char strings[2000];

lint -hpc reports:
	"file1.c", line 2: static variable stringsc$ unused
	...
	string multiply declared	"file1.c"(2)  ::  "file2.c"(1)

Both complaints are wrong.  In the first, lint is mixing up variables
and functions (there is a later complaint about the unused function,
which I left out because it's legitimate).  In the second, lint is
complaining about name conflicts between names that are supposed
to be strictly local to their respective files and hence nonconflicting.
