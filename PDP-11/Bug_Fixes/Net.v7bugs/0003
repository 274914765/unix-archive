Subject: bug in exece()
Cc:  tbl jfr mhtsa!ted

there is a nasty bug in exece() (which appeared in 50 changes)
after the
	bp = bread(swapdev, (daddr_t)(dbtofsb(swplo+bno)+(nc>>BSHIFT)));
put
	bp->b_flags &= ~B_DELWRI;
else the buffer may stay in the cache with DELWRI set and clobber a
random block in the swap area at some later time.
