uux bug
A bug in uux prevents the - option from working with binary files.
To fix it, in uux.c, search for "fputs".  (It's in an if (pipein) {.)
replace the fgets/fputs loop by
		while ((c = getc(stdin)) != EOF)
			putc(c, fpd);
and declare c somewhere to be an int.  (I put the line
		register int c;
right after the if (pipein).)

Fixing this bug will allow the new uusend program, which will be released
shortly, to work, allowing the transfer of binary files across indirect
uucp links.
