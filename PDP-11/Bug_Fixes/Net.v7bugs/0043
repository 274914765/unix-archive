fix to fix to uucp bug

This is a correction to ittvax.149, which reported a fix to UUCP. I
confess Art Feather was the one who made the patch and tested it; I
reported the bug and the fix without having recompiled and tested (for
shame, for shame).  As a result, an editing error leaving in an extra
')' in my copy of the change never got caught.

I won't go through the executable patch procedure again but in
anlwrk.c, on or around line 67 which in the distribution reads:

 	if (listp == NULL || *listp == NULL || listp > (list + LLEN)

should read:

 	if (listp == NULL || listp >= &list[LLEN] || *listp == NULL

instead of:

 	if (listp == NULL || *listp == NULL || listp >= &list[LLEN])

as the earlier news article stated.

Thanks to duke!trt who suggested the evaluation order change and
wolfvax!root who pointed out the parenthesis error.  The present
evaluation order is ``safe'' but certainly not clear thinking.

Sorry for the earlier bum steer.
