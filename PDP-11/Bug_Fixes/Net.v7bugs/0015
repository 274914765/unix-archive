du bug
"du" works incorrectly if given a list of pathnames
in which a relative pathname (one not beginning with '/')
follows a pathname containing a '/':
	cd /; du usr/tmp etc
The reason is that in such cases "du" uses chdir()
to leave the current directory, never to return.
One cure is for "du" to invoke "pwd" initially
to be able to get back to the current directory ("find" does that).

Also, if there is more than one pathname argument
there should be a grand total at the end -- it is often what is wanted.
The documented non-directory argument bug should be fixed, too.
And the diagnostic messages are not so hot either ...
