Tar bug
There is a tar bug in the distributed v7: if you specify "-w" in
the arguments, the confirmation prompt is written to stdout.  If
you happen to specify "-wf -", this causes havoc.  The fix is
pretty obvious.

I haven't addressed the converse problem: that of "-xwf -"...  If
you trust that stderr is really opened mode 2 (as the distributed
init does), a similar fix will work.
