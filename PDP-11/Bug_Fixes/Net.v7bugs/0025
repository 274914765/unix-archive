uucico hanging
We have been having a problem with a slave uucico
hanging and have identified one cause of this problem.
It turns out that there is no timeout provisions for
the protocol starting routine "startup".  The following
is a simple if not pretty patch to cico.c to provide
the timeout.
	309,311c309,315
	<	ret = startup(Role);
	<	if (ret != SUCCESS) {
	<		logent("startup", "FAILED");
	---
	> 	alarm(MAXMSGTIME);
	> 	if (setjmp(Sjbuf))
	> 		goto Failure;
	> 	ret = startup(Role);
	> 	alarm(0);
	> 	if (ret != SUCCESS) {
	> Failure:	logent("startup", "FAILED");
I understand that there are other problems with uucico hanging
which this does not explain.
