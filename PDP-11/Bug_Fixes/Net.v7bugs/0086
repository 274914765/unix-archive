misconception in uucico
The program uucico terminates each string
it sends in the expect-send sequence with
a '\n'.  This is conceptually incorrect,
since the line it is transmitting over is
supposed to look like a terminal; hence the
the '\n' should be a '\r' (see conn.c/sendthem).
The reason uucico works now is because getty accepts
both '\n' and '\r'; however, if a port contender
is used with automatic baud-rate detect (keyed
off of '\r')....
