/bin/sh bug
With sh if you say

	$ var=value command

then "var" is temporarily exported into the environment
for the execution of "command". But you cannot say

	$ exec var=value command

because the silly shell tries to execute "var=value", and
if you say

	$ var=value exec command

then "command" gets executed but "var" doesn't get exported.
