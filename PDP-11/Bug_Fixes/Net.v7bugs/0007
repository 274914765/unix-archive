There is a bug in col as distributed which causes garbage sometimes
at the end of outputs, such as /usr/doc/uucp/implement.  The procedure
"main" ends in "return 0" rather than "exit(0);".  Changing it to exit
makes the problem go away.  The bug was exhibited on a Vax running
Berkeley Unix and might not show up on some other systems, depending on
their runtime startup routine.
