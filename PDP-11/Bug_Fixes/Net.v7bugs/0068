shell [mis?]feature
The shell sometimes ``knows'' characters are in quotes and should not
be interpreted as metacharacters etc.;  this is a win in many situations
but loses sometimes:

	set `echo "'a b'" "'c d'"`

yields positional parameters with imbedded quotes.  This is the heart
of the problem in getting the getopt(1) I sent out a little while ago
to cope properly with arguments with embedded metacharacters etc.
