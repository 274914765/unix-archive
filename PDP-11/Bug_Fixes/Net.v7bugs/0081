versatec plot software
The documentation in plot(5) lies about the "natural" space() setting
of the Versatec.  The Versatec filter appears to have been crudely
converted for use with fanfold paper, with the result that the size
of the plot space is constrained by the 8.5-inch height of Versatec
fanfold sheets (and the Versatec's unwillingness to plot too close to
the folds).  The true space() specification for the Versatec is:

	space(0, 0, 1536, 1536)

Since sensible installations generally use roll paper, the filter
should be modified appropriately.  This shouldn't be hard but I
haven't tried it yet.
