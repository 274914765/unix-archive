cpio bug
Subject: cpio bug

(This really concerns the internal BTL version of unix, 4.0, but is
probably a more general problem).

I have had several files that had been put through cpio into an
archive and out again slightly altered.  Wherever there was a 0 byte
(null), it and the following character dissappeared.  I can't find
any reference in the documentation for cpio that it won't take files
with nulls in them, and I am reasonably sure that I have used cpio
archives for binary files before.  Is this a bug or a misfeature?
Has anyone else been similarly burned?
