non-I/D floating point, cont.
Fred Canter of Dec Merrimack informs me that the fpp bug will be fixed
in their next release [they knew about it already].  Dennis Ritchie
says the bug is still in the current research Unix;  apparently only
Ken's chess machine has a non-I/D cpu with floating point, and it
seems Ken doesn't multiprogram much...
