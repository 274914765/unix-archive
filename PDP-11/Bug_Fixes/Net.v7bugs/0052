sizeof type botch
The following program displays a bug in the V7 C compiler.  Whether this
should be fixed by revising the documentation or changing the code is a
good question.

/*
 * sizeof is supposed to be semantically an integer constant.  It's not,
 * in the V7 compiler:  its type is always "unsigned", which an integer
 * constant never is.
 */

#define	BIG	20000	/* 40000 / sizeof(int) */

int foo[BIG];

main()
{
	printf("%D == %D (!)\n", 40000, sizeof(foo));
}
