plot(1,3) incompletenesses
Support for some of the graphics primitives described in plot(5) is
rather incomplete.  Notably, in the software as supplied, only the
4014 supports circles and arcs.  The 4014 code could probably be
transplanted easily enough -- it does them "by hand" rather than
using terminal smarts -- but I haven't tried this yet.
