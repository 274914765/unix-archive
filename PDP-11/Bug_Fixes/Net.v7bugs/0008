The buffer-flush bug in col(1) that was mentioned in previous news
is due to using an automatic (local) variable for buffering stdout:
	char fbuff[BUFSIZ];
should be changed to
	static char fbuff[BUFSIZ];
(exit() also works since main() will not return before flushing.)
Col(1) is just one of several V7 programs with this flaw.

In the Duke version of stdio one can bypass the problem with
	setbuf(stdout, SYSBUF);
where SYSBUF is a flag indicating buffering is desired.
