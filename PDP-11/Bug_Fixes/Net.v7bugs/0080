man(7) @ bug
The manual-page macros will screw up in several places if the input
contains at-signs.  In particular, if there is an @ in a page header
or footer, or in the label line of a .TP, madness will ensue.  The
fix is straightforward:  change all the @'s in tmac.an to control-B.
(Not control-A, since that is the n/troff leader character!)
