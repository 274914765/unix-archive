fopen bug
I have just encountered a bug in fopen(3). When a file is opened in
"a" mode and a line written out to that file, the first two chars
in the line turn to junk. This does not happen if an explicit
fseek(file,0L,2) is done first! Is this a known bug or just a
peculiarity of our stdio library?
