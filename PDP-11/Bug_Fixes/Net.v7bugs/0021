ldiv/lrem on 23, ch.2
Addendum to my previous NET.v7bugs message about the ldiv/lrem bug on
the 44 and 23:  the people who discovered that the problem also occurs
on the 23 have supplied test cases.  If you want to see the problem on
a 23, try  11335500/100  or  11335577%100  .  Thanks to Chris Sturgess
and Ron Gomes of Human Computing Resources for this one.
