spell(1) options
As distributed with V7, the -x option to spell(1) does not work, at all.
/usr/lib/spell is prepared to handle it but never gets to see it, because
somebody forgot to allow for it in /bin/spell.  The fix is to add the
following line just before the -a line:

	-x)	B="$B -x" ;;

Also, -v is misdocumented;  many people misread it as printing plausible
derivations for things spell couldn't find at all.
