dd feature, again
This is a retransmission of a message that was garbled for at least
some sites by a stupidity in B news.

>An undocumented feature in dd:  a cbs of 0 in association with ascii
or ebcdic conversion gives code conversion without padding, trimming,
or special handling of end-of-line.
