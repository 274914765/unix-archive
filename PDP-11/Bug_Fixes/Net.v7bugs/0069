uuxqt security hole
uuxqt takes pains to restrict the PATH variable; unfortunately it never
exports it!  Just tack on "export PATH;" to the #define PATH near the
beginning of uuxqt.c.  (Actually it appears from the sh man entry that
you could just replace the trailing ';' with a space, but I'm no sh expert.)
This occurs in both vanilla v7 and 4.1bsd at least.
