mail bug
The V7 mail(1) program has an annoying habit of not
behaving properly on rather long entries.  The problem
is in the routine "copylet" when a difference of two
long integers is stored as an int.  The following should
fix the problem.
	325c325,328
	< {	int ch, k;
	---
	> {
	> 	int ch;
	> 	long k;
	>
