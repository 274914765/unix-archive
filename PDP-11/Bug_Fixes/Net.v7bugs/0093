cp misfeature
The command "cp <directory> <file>" will work, but does not yield a very
intelligible file as a result.  Most naive users don't really grasp the
notion that directories are just a special kind of file, and are confused
by the appearance of this strange little gibberish file.  We found this
a headache, and since the command seems singularly useless, we added
the following code just after the assignment to "mode" in cp.c/copy():

	if ((mode&S_IFMT) == S_IFDIR) {
		close(fold);
		fprintf(stderr, "cp: %s is a directory -- ignored.\n", from);
		return(1);
	}
