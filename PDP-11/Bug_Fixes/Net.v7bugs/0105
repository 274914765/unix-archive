Re: overflow in C revisited
"The action taken on overflow or underflow depends on the machine at
hand." (Kernighan+Ritchie, "The C Programming Language", Prentice-Hall,
1978, p.38) "The handling of overflow and divide check in expression
evaluation is machine-dependent." (ibid. p.185)
Although you may claim that invoking machine dependence is inexact in
a language specification, you cannot claim that the C specification
"ignores" overflow.
