i_count too small
The i_count field of the in-core inode structure is a char.  This is not
necessarily enough on a big system where counts can get large.  Damage
potential is considerable.  It is difficult to do anything intelligent
about this except enlarge the field to a short (or maybe int);  putting
a ceiling on the count just postpones the problem, as was described a
while ago in net.bugs.2bsd.  I haven't tried the enlargement yet.
