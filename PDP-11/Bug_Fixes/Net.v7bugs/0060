stdio buffering
Although setbuf(3) states that any output stream directed to a terminal
is unbuffered by default, this in fact is wrong.  In fact, only stdout
is checked to see whether it is going to a terminal and should therefore
be unbuffered.  I checked with DMR, he says the documentation is wrong.
So the last paragraph of DESCRIPTION in setbuf(3) should be changed to
read something like:
	A buffer is normally obtained from
	.IR  malloc (3)
	upon the first
	.I getc
	or
	.IR  putc (3)
	on the file,
	except that the standard output stream
	.I stdout
	is normally not buffered when directed to a terminal,
	and the standard error stream
	.I stderr
	is normally not buffered.

(the changes are to the last 6 lines).

Ron Gomes of Human Computing Resources found this one.
