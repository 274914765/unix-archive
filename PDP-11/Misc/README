md5 contains the MD5 hash program used to generate the contents of the
top-level file `checksums'.

fpsim.tar contains a floating-point simulator for 7th Edition, donated by
Henry Spencer. Here are the details from the man page:

	This system provides for software emulation of floating-point
	instructions if floating-point hardware is not present. The
	kernel code in question simulates an FP11 floating-point
	processor by intercepting illegal-instruction traps and
	decoding and interpreting the floating-point opcodes.

	This simulator is derived from Bell's, which used signal(2)
	and was compiled into the user program. Mike Tilson of HCR
	thought of and did the original kernel-mode simulator;
	this improved variant by Henry Spencer.
