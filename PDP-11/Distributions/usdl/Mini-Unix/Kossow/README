Subject: [TUHS] mini-unix distribution tape recovered
    
I beleive I have sucessfully read a Dec, 1979 mini-unix
distribution tape yesterday evening. I've placed it for
the next week or so under http://bitsavers.org/miniunix
    
It is in .tap format, which should work with SIMH.
  
It is a single large file blocked 512 bytes/record
