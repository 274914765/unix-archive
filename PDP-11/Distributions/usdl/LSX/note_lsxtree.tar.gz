Hi Warren!

This is what I have. I did not have the files handy, so I took
http://www.mailcom.com/lsx/lsximgs.tar.bz2
and applied the u6-fstool from http://sourceforge.net/projects/bkunix/

It seems that one of the files is corrupted (srcam/run.bad) due to a
read error of the original floppy.

Best regards,
Leo
