In 1987, DEC gave UCB the right to distribute any or all of Ultrix-11
in the BSD distributions. The e-mail exchange is provided below.

	If Berkeley purchases the AT&T and ULTIRX-11 source licenses,
	we'll write a letter that gives them the right to include anything
	they want from ULTRIX-11 in their own distribution. I'll
	forward you the procedure for purchasing sources.

Hi Michael,

UEG is going to give CSRG permission to include any/all sources from 
ULTRIX-11
in their 2.10 BSD release (for pdp-11's).

As soon as the letter confirming this arrives, Keith Bostic (my 
officemate)
would like to order ULTRIX-11 sources.   You might give him a 
call/send
mail (bostic@okeeffe.berkeley.edu) in about a month.

Here's the note from the Product Manager, Laurie Buller, about how to
order the source kit:

	From buller%smurf.DEC@decwrl.dec.com Thu Dec 17 12:11:44 1987
	Date: Thu, 17 Dec 87 12:11:31 PST
	To: jean@okeeffe.berkeley.edu
	Subject: RE: Something else from ULTRIX-11?

	Ordering U-11 sources is simple. Tell the DEC account
	rep the CPU type and serial number, and the number of
	the AT&T license (E-SOFT-xxxxxxxxx).  The account rep
	will give that information to CAS (our order admin system)
	and the rest is magic. The order number for U-11 sources
	is QJ828-MM and the price is a mere $750.

Everyone here is pretty surprised with UEG's willingness to do this.
But happy.   The next question I was asked wsa if I could now get them
to give the sources for the BI code ...

		all the best in 1988,
		jean

Keith,

This is just to confirm Jean's message to you in regard to Ultrix-11 
sources.
The ordering info is as follows:

Part Number    Description               Berkeley Price
-----------    -----------               --------------
QJ828-MM       Ultrix-11 Sources         $788.

The other information (cpu serial number, AT&T license etc.) can be 
put
on your purchase requisition so that purchasing types it on the p.o.

Drop me mail if you have any questions.

michael
