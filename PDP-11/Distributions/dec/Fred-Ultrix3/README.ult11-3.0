DEC ULTRX-11 V3.0 Master Distribution Kit


This directory contains the files needed to build a complete
installation kit of version 3.0 of the ULTRIX-11 Unix system
for the DEC PDP-11.

This distribution contains files from both the V3.0 binary
kit donated to PUPS by Ken Wellsch.  Some of the tools used
to initially dump the tapes (rat, wat and wtu) were also Ken's
idea.

To get the ball rolling, check the value of the TAPE variable
at the top of the "build" script.  It is set to what MY tape
device (TK50 on TQK50 controller) under Ultrix-11 V3.1 is,
so you may have to change it.

Then, type

    ./build

and watch things go.  After about an hour of tape activity,
you should be woken up by two BEEPs telling you that it is all
done.  Unload the tape and you're all set.

If you run into problems, drop me a note!

Have fun !
