	I used kermit (..) to copy Unix V7 files from my aging
	8" floppies. It is a somewhat weird set of stuff, but e.g.
	the device driver sources might be interesting. There is
	some stuff that might be homegrown by Nijmegen University
	and not in general circulation.

	Anyway, check it out to see if it makes any sense.
