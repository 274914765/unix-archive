I have split the orginal 2 MB venix2.zip into two parts, each of
which is small enough to fit on a 1.2 MB DOS floppy.

Two of the teledisk images in the original venix2.zip were reported
to have CRC errors. I have uploaded the two images again in vnx2u2u5.zip. 
If you previously downloaded the 2MB version of venix2.zip, you
will need to patch it with vnx2u2u5.zip.

The new 1MB archives have the corrected images in them.
