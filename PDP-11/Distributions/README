In most directories you will find one or more gzip'd tape images. Where
possible, I have also made a tar file corresponding to the contents of each
tape.

The file DETAILS in this directory explains what is in each subdirectory.
The file RELEASE_DATES lists the release dates for many things, as far as
I can make out.
