<h1>
Setting Up
Unix
- Seventh Edition
</h1>

<p>
The distribution tape can be used only on a DEC PDP11/45
or PDP11/70 with RP03, RP04, RP05, RP06 disks and with
a TU10, TU16, or TE16 tape drive.
It consists of some preliminary bootstrapping programs followed by
two file system images;
if needed, after the initial construction of the file systems
individual files can be extracted. (See restor(1))
<p>
If you are set up to do it,
it might be a good idea immediately to make a copy of the
tape to guard against disaster.
The tape is 9-track 800 BPI and contains some 512-byte records
followed by many 10240-byte records.
There are interspersed tapemarks.
<p>
The system as distributed contains binary images
of the system and all the user level programs, along with source
and manual sections for them--about
2100 files altogether.
The binary images,
along with other
things needed to flesh out the file system enough so UNIX will run,
are to be put on one file system called the `root file system'.
The file system size required is about 5000 blocks.
The file second system has all of the source and documentation.
Altogether it amounts to more than 18,000 512-byte blocks.
<h2>
Making a Disk From Tape
</h2>
<p>
Perform the following bootstrap procedure to obtain
a disk with a root file system on it.
<dl>
<dt>1.<dd>
Mount the magtape on drive 0 at load point.
<dt>2.<dd>
Mount a formatted disk pack on drive 0.
<dt>3.<dd>
Key in and execute at 100000
</dl>
<dl><dt><dd>
  TU10			  TU16/TE16
<br>
012700			Use the DEC ROM or other
<br>
172526			means to load block 1
<br>
010040			(i.e. second block) at 800 BPI
<br>
012740			into location 0 and transfer
<br>
060003			to 0.
<br>
000777
<br>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
The tape should move and the CPU loop.
(The TU10 code is
<i>
not
</i>
the DEC bulk ROM for tape;
it reads block 0, not block 1.)
<li>4.<br>
If you used the above TU10 code, halt and restart the
CPU at 0, otherwise continue to the next step.
<li>5.<br>
The console should type
<dl><dt><dd>
<i>
<br>
Boot
<br>
:
<br>
</i>
<br>
</dl>
Copy the magtape to disk by the following procedure.
The machine's printouts are shown in italic,
explanatory comments are within ( ).
Terminate each line you type by carriage return or line-feed.
There are two classes of tape drives:
the name `tm' is used for the TU10, and `ht' is used for
the TU16 or TE16.
There are also two classes of disks:
`rp' is used for the RP03, and `hp' is used for the
RP04/5/6.
</ul>
<p>
If you should make a mistake while typing, the character '#'
erases the last character typed up to the beginning of the line,
and the character '@' erases the entire line typed.
Some consoles cannot print lower case letters, adjust the
instructions accordingly.
<dl><dt><dd>
(bring in the program mkfs)
<br>
<i>:</i>tm(0,3)		(use `ht(0,3)' for the TU16/TE16)
<br>
<i>file system size:</i> 5000
<br>
<i>file system:</i> rp(0,0)		(use `hp(0,0)' for RP04/5/6)
<br>
<i>
<br>
isize = XX
<br>
m/n = XX
<br>
</i>
<br>
(after a while)
<br>
<i>
<br>
exit called
<br>
Boot
<br>
:
<br>
</i>
<br>
</dl>
This step makes an empty file system.
<dl>
<dt>6.<dd>
The next thing to do is to restore the data
onto the new empty file system. To do this you respond to
the `<i>:</i>' printed in the last step with
<dl><dt><dd>
(bring in the program restor)
<br>
<i>:</i>tm(0,4)		(`ht(0,4)' for TU16/TE16)
<br>
<i>tape?</i> tm(0,5)	(use `ht(0,5)' for TU16/TE16)
<br>
<i>disk?</i> rp(0,0)		(use `hp(0,0)' for RP04/5/6)
<br>
<i>Last chance before scribbling on disk.</i> (you type return)
<br>
(the tape moves, perhaps 5-10 minutes pass)
<br>
<i>end of tape</i>
<br>
<i>
<br>
Boot
<br>
:
<br>
</i>
<br>
</dl>
You now have a UNIX root file system.
</dl>
<h2>
Booting UNIX
</h2>
<p>
You probably have
the bootstrap running, left over from the last step above;
if not,
repeat the boot process (step 3) again.
Then use one of the following:
<dl><dt><dd>
<i>:</i>rp(0,0)rptmunix		(for RP03 and TU10)
<br>
<i>:</i>rp(0,0)rphtunix		(for RP03 and TU16/TE16)
<br>
<i>:</i>hp(0,0)hptmunix		(for RP04/5/6 and TU10)
<br>
<i>:</i>hp(0,0)hphtunix		(for RP04/5/6 and TU16/TE16)
<br>
</dl>
The machine should type the following:
<dl><dt><dd>
<i>
<br>
mem = xxx
<br>
#
<br>
</i>
<br>
</dl>
The
<i>
mem
</i>
message gives the memory available to user programs
in bytes.
<p>
UNIX is now running,
and the `UNIX Programmer's manual' applies;
references below of the form X(Y) mean the subsection named
X in section Y of the manual.
The `#' is the prompt from the Shell,
and indicates you are the super-user.
The user name of the super-user is `root'
if you should find yourself in multi-user mode and
need to log in;
the password is also `root'.
<p>
To simplify your life later, rename the appropriate version
of the system as specified above plain `unix.'
For example, use mv (1) as follows if you have an RP04/5/6 and
a TU16 tape:
<dl><dt><dd>
mv hphtunix unix
<br>
</dl>
In the future, when you reboot,
you can type just
<dl><dt><dd>
hp(0,0)unix
<br>
</dl>
to the `:' prompt.
(Choose appropriately among `hp', `rp', `ht', `tm'
according to your configuration).
<p>
You now need to make some special file entries
in the dev directory. These specify what sort of disk you
are running on, what sort of tape drive you have,
and where the file systems are. 
For simplicity, this recipe creates fixed device names.
These names will be used below, and some of them are built into
various programs, so they are most convenient.
However, the names do not always represent the actual major and
minor device in the manner suggested in section 4 of the
Programmer's Manual.
For example, `rp3' will be used for the name of the file system
on which the user file system is put, even though it might be on an RP06
and is not logical device 3.
Also, this sequence will put the user file system on the same
disk drive as the root, which is not the best place
if you have more than one drive.
Thus the prescription below should be taken only as one example
of where to put things.
See also the section on `Disk layout' below.
<p>
In any event, change to the dev directory (cd(1)) and, if you like,
examine and perhaps change the makefile there (make (1)).
<dl><dt><dd>
cd /dev
<br>
cat makefile
<br>
</dl>
Then, use one of
<dl><dt><dd>
make rp03
<br>
make rp04
<br>
make rp05
<br>
make rp06
<br>
</dl>
depending on which disk you have.
Then, use one of
<dl><dt><dd>
make tm
<br>
make ht
<br>
</dl>
depending on which tape you have.
The file `rp0' refers to the root file system;
`swap' to the swap-space file system; `rp3' to the
user file system.
The devices `rrp0' and `rrp3' are the `raw' versions
of the disks.
Also, `mt0' is tape drive 0, at 800 BPI;
`rmt0' is the raw tape, on which large records can be read
and written;
`nrmt0' is raw tape with the quirk that it does not rewind
on close, which is a subterfuge that permits
multifile tapes to be handled.
<p>
The next thing to do is to extract the rest of the data from
the tape.
Comments are enclosed in ( ); don't type these.
The number in the first command is the
size of the file system;
it differs between RP03, RP04/5, and RP06.
<dl><dt><dd>
/etc/mkfs /dev/rp3 74000	(153406 if on RP04/5, 322278 on RP06)
<br>
(The above command takes about 2-3 minutes on an RP03)
<br>
dd if=/dev/nrmt0 of=/dev/null bs=20b files=6	(skip 6 files on the tape)
<br>
restor rf /dev/rmt0 /dev/rp3	(restore the file system)
<br>
(Reply with a `return' (CR) to the `Last chance' message)
<br>
(The restor takes about 20-30 minutes)
<br>
</dl>
All of the data on the tape has been extracted.
<p>
You may at this point mount the source
file system (mount(1)). To do this type the following:
<dl><dt><dd>
/etc/mount /dev/rp3 /usr
<br>
</dl>
The source and manual
pages are now available in subdirectories of /usr.
<p>
The above mount command is only needed if you
intend to play around with source on a single
user system, which you are going to do next.
The file system is mounted automatically when multi-user
mode is entered, by a command in the file
/etc/rc. (See `Disk Layout' below).
<p>
Before anything further is done the bootstrap
block on the disk (block 0) should be filled in.
This is done using the command
<dl><dt><dd>
dd if=/usr/mdec/rpuboot of=/dev/rp0 count=1
<br>
</dl>
if you have the RP03, or
<dl><dt><dd>
dd if=/usr/mdec/hpuboot of=/dev/rp0 count=1
<br>
</dl>
if you have an RP04/5/6.
Now the DEC disk bootstraps are usable.
See Boot Procedures(8) for further information.
<p>
Before UNIX is turned up completely,
a few configuration dependent exercises must be
performed.
At this point,
it would be wise to read all of the manuals
(especially `Regenerating System Software')
and to augment this reading with hand to hand
combat.
<h2>
Reconfiguration
</h2>
<p>
The UNIX system running is configured to run
with the given disk
and tape, a console, and no other device.
This is certainly not the correct
configuration.
You will have to correct the configuration table to reflect
the true state of your machine.
<p>
It is wise at this point to know how to recompile the system.
Print (cat(1))
the file /usr/sys/conf/makefile.
This file is input to the program `make(1)' which
if invoked with `make all' will recompile all of
the system source and
install it in the correct libraries.
<p>
The program mkconf(1) prepares files that
describe a given configuration (See mkconf(1)).
In the /usr/sys/conf directory,
the four files
<i>xy</i>conf
were input to mkconf to produce the four versions of the system
<i>xy</i>unix.
Pick the appropriate one, and edit it to add lines describing your own configuration.
(Remember the console typewriter is automatically included;
don't count it in the kl specification.)
Then run mkconf;
it will generate the files l.s
(trap vectors) c.c (configuration table),
and mch0.s.
Take a careful look at
l.s to make sure that all the devices that you
have are assembled in the correct interrupt vectors.
If your configuration is non-standard, you will
have to modify l.s to fit your configuration.
<p>
There are certain magic numbers and
configuration parameters imbedded in various
device drivers that you may want to change.
The device addresses of each device
are defined in each driver.
In case you have any non-standard device
addresses,
just change the address and recompile.
(The device drivers are in the directory
/usr/sys/dev.)
<p>
The DC11 driver is set to run 4 lines.
This can be changed in dc.c.
<p>
The DH11 driver is set to handle 3 DH11's with
a full complement of 48 lines.
If you have less, or more, 
you may want to edit dh.c.
<p>
The DN11 driver will handle 4 DN's.
Edit dn.c.
<p>
The DU11 driver can only handle a single DU.
This cannot be easily changed.
<p>
The KL/DL driver is set up to run
a single DL11-A, -B, or -C (the console)
and no DL11-E's.
To change this, edit
kl.c to have NKL11 reflect the total number of
DL11-ABC's and
NDL11 to reflect the number of DL11-E's.
So far as the driver is concerned,
the difference between the devices is
their address.
<p>
All of the disk and tape drivers
(rf.c, rk.c, rp.c, tm.c, tc.c,
hp.c, ht.c)
are set up to run 8 drives and should not
need to be changed.
The big disk drivers (rp.c and hp.c)
have partition tables in them which you
may want to experiment with.
<p>
After all the corrections
have been made,
use `make(1)' to recompile the system (or
recompile individually if you wish: use the makefile
as a guide).
If you compiled individually, say `make unix' in the
directory /usr/sys/conf.
The final object file (unix) should be
moved to the root, and then booted to try it out.
It is best to name it /nunix so as not to destroy
the working system until you're sure it does work.
See Boot Procedures(8) for a discussion
of booting.
Note:  before taking the system down,
always (!!) perform
a sync(1)
to force delayed output to the disk.
<h2>
Special Files
</h2>
<p>
Next you must put in special files for the new devices in
the directory /dev using mknod(1).
Print the configuration file
c.c created above.
This is the major
device switch of each device class (block and character).
There is one line for each device configured in your system
and a null line for place holding for those devices
not configured.
The essential block special files were installed above;
for any new devices,
the major device number is selected by counting the
line number (from zero)
of the device's entry in the block configuration table.
Thus the first entry in the table bdevsw would be
major device zero.
This number is also printed in the table along the right margin.
<p>
The minor device is the drive number,
unit number or partition as described
under each device in section 4 of the manual.
For tapes where the unit is dial selectable,
a special file may be made for each possible
selection.
You can also add entries for other disk drives.
<p>
In reality, device names are arbitrary. It is usually
convenient to have a system for deriving names, but it doesn't
have to be the one presented above.
<p>
Some further notes on minor device numbers.
The hp driver uses the 0100 bit of the minor device number to
indicate whether or not to interleave a file system across
more than one physical device. See hp(4) for more detail.
The tm and ht drivers use the 0200 bit to indicate whether
or not to rewind the tape when it is closed. The
0100 bit indicates the density of the tape on TU16 drives.
By convention, tape special files with the 0200 bit on have an `n'
prepended to their name, as in /dev/nmt0 or /dev/nrmt1.
Again, see tm(4) or ht(4).
<p>
The naming of character devices is similar to block devices.
Here the names are even more arbitrary except that
devices meant to be used
for teletype access should (to avoid confusion, no other reason) be named
/dev/ttyX, where X is some string (as in `00' or `library').
The files console, mem, kmem, and null are
already correctly configured.
<p>
The disk and magtape drivers provide a `raw' interface
to the device which provides direct transmission
between the user's core and the device and allows
reading or writing large records.
The raw device counts as a character device,
and should have the name of the corresponding
standard block special file with `r' prepended.
(The `n' for no rewind tapes violates this rule.)
Thus the raw magtape
files would be called /dev/rmtX.
These special files should be made.
<p>
When all the special files have been created,
care should be taken to change
the access modes (chmod(1))
on these files to appropriate values (probably 600 or 644).
<h2>
Floating Point
</h2>
<p>
UNIX only supports (and really expects to have) the FP11-B/C
floating point unit.
For machines without this hardware,
there is a user subroutine
available that will catch illegal instruction
traps and interpret floating point operations.
(See fptrap(3).)
To install this subroutine in the library, change to /usr/src/libfpsim
and execute the shell files
<dl><dt><dd>
	compall
<br>
	mklib
<br>
</dl>
The system as delivered does not have this code included
in any command,
although the operating system adapts automatically to the
presence or absence of the FP11.
<p>
Next, a floating-point version of
the C compiler in /usr/src/cmd/c
should be compiled using the commands:
<dl><dt><dd>
cd /usr/src/cmd/c
<br>
make fc1
<br>
mv fc1 /lib/fc1
<br>
</dl>
This allows programs with floating point constants
to be compiled.
To compile floating point programs use the `-f'
flag to cc(1). This flag ensures that the floating
point interpreter is loaded with the program and that
the floating point version of `cc' is used.
<h2>
Time Conversion
</h2>
<p>
If your machine is not in the Eastern time zone,
you must edit (ed(1)) the file
/usr/sys/h/param.h
to reflect your local time.
The manifest `TIMEZONE' should be changed
to reflect the time difference between local time and GMT in minutes.
For EST, this is 5*60; for PST it would be 8*60.
Finally, there is a `DSTFLAG'
manifest;
when it is 1 it causes the
time to shift to Daylight Savings automatically
between the last Sundays in April and October
(or other algorithms in 1974 and 1975).
Normally this will not have to be reset.
When the needed changes are done, recompile and load the
system using
make(1)
and install it.
(As a general rule, when a system header file is changed,
the entire system should be recompiled.
As it happens, the only uses of these flags are in
/usr/sys/sys/sys4.c, so if this is all that was changed it
alone needs to be recompiled.)
<p>
You may also want to look at timezone(3)
(/usr/src/libc/gen/timezone.c) to see
if the name of your timezone is in its internal table.
If needed, edit the changes in.
After timezone.c has been edited
it should be compiled and installed in
its library.
(See /usr/src/libc/(mklib and compall))
Then you should
(at your leisure)
recompile and reinstall
all programs that use it (such as date(1)).
<h2>
Disk Layout
</h2>
<p>
If
there are to be more file systems mounted than just the root
and /usr,
use mkfs(1) to create any new file system and
put its mounting in the file /etc/rc (see init(8) and mount(1)).
(You might look at /etc/rc anyway to
see what has been provided for you.)
<p>
There are two considerations in deciding how to adjust the arrangement
of things on your disks:
the most important is making sure there is adequate space
for what is required;
secondarily, throughput should be maximized.
Swap space is a critical parameter.
The system
as distributed has 8778 (hpunix) or 2000 (rpunix) blocks 
for swap space.
This should be large enough so running out of swap space never
occurs.
You may want to change these if local wisdom indicates otherwise.
<p>
The system as distributed has all of the binaries in /bin.
Most of
them should be moved to /usr/bin, leaving only the ones required for
system maintenance (such as icheck, dcheck, cc, ed, restor, etc.) and the most
heavily used in /bin.
This will speed things up a bit if you have only one disk, and also free
up space on the root file system for temporary files. (See below).
<p>
Many common system programs (C, the editor, the assembler etc.)
create intermediate files in the /tmp directory,
so the file system where this is stored also should be made
large enough to accommodate
most high-water marks.
If you leave the root file system as distributed
(except as discussed above) there
should be no problem.
All the programs that create files in /tmp take
care to delete them, but most are not immune to
events like being hung up upon, and can leave dregs.
The directory should be examined every so often and the old
files deleted.
<p>
Exhaustion of user-file space is certain to occur
now and then;
the only mechanisms for controlling this phenomenon
are occasional use of du(1), df(1), quot(1), threatening
messages of the day, and personal letters.
<p>
The efficiency with which UNIX is able to use the CPU
is largely dictated by the configuration of disk controllers.
For general time-sharing applications,
the best strategy is to try to split user files,
the root directory (including the /tmp directory)
and the swap area among three controllers.
<p>
Once you have decided how to make best use
of your hardware, the question is how to initialize it.
If you have the equipment,
the best way to move a file system
is to dump it (dump(1)) to magtape,
use mkfs(1) to create the new file system,
and restore (restor(1)) the tape.
If for some reason you don't want to use magtape,
dump accepts an argument telling where to put the dump;
you might use another disk.
Sometimes a file system has to be increased in logical size
without copying.
The super-block of the device has a word
giving the highest address which can be allocated.
For relatively small increases, this word can be patched
using the debugger (adb(1))
and the free list reconstructed using icheck(1).
The size should not be increased very greatly
by this technique, however,
since although the allocatable space will increase
the maximum number of files will not (that is, the i-list
size can't be changed).
Read and understand the description given in file system(5)
before playing around in this way.
You may want to
see section rp(4) for some suggestions
on how to lay out the information on RP disks.
<p>
If you have to merge a file system into another, existing one,
the best bet is to
use tar(1).
If you must shrink a file system, the best bet is to dump
the original and restor it onto the new filesystem.
However, this might not work if the i-list on the smaller filesystem
is smaller than the maximum allocated inode on the larger.
If this is the case, reconstruct the filesystem from scratch
on another filesystem (perhaps using tar(1)) and then dump it.
If you
are playing with the root file system and only have one drive
the procedure is more complicated. What you do is the following:
<dl>
<dt>1.<dd>
GET A SECOND PACK!!!!
<dt>2.<dd>
Dump the current root filesystem (or the reconstructed one) using dump(1).
<dt>3.<dd>
Bring the system down and mount the new pack.
<dt>4.<dd>
Retrieve the WECo distribution tape and perform steps 1 through
5 at the beginning of this document,
substituting the desired file system size instead of 5000
when asked for `file system size'.
<dt>5.<dd>
Perform step 6 above up to the point where the `tape'
question is asked. At this point mount the tape
you made just a few minutes ago. Continue with step 6 above substituting
a 0 (zero) for the 5.
</dl>
<h2>
New Users
</h2>
<p>
Install new users by editing the password file
/etc/passwd (passwd(5)).
This procedure should be done once multi-user mode is entered
(see init(8)).
You'll have to make a current directory for each new user
and change its owner to the
newly installed name.
Login as each user to make sure the password
file is correctly edited.
For example:
<dl><dt><dd>
ed /etc/passwd
<br>
$a
<br>
joe::10:1::/usr/joe:
<br>
w
<br>
q
<br>
mkdir /usr/joe
<br>
chown joe /usr/joe
<br>
login joe
<br>
ls -la
<br>
login root
<br>
</dl>
This will make a new login entry for joe,
who should be encouraged to use passwd(1)
to give himself a password.
His default current directory is
/usr/joe
which has been created.
The delivered password file
has the user
<i>
bin
</i>
in it to be used as a prototype.
<h2>
Multiple Users
</h2>
<p>
If UNIX is to support simultaneous
access from more than just the console terminal,
the file /etc/ttys (ttys(5)) has to be edited.
To add a new terminal be sure the device is configured
and the special file exists, then set
the first character of the appropriate line of /etc/ttys to 1
(or add a new line).
Note that init.c will have to be recompiled if there are to be
more than 100 terminals.
Also note that if the special file is inaccessible when init tries to create a process
for it, the system will thrash trying and retrying to open it.
<h2>
File System Health
</h2>
<p>
Periodically (say every day or so) and always after a crash,
you should check all the file systems for consistency
(icheck, dcheck(1)).
It is quite important to execute sync (8)
before rebooting or taking the machine down.
This is done automatically every 30 seconds by the update
program (8) when a multiple-user system is running,
but you should do it anyway to make sure.
<p>
Dumping of the file system should be done regularly,
since once the system is going it is very easy to
become complacent.
Complete and incremental dumps are easily done with
dump(1).
Dumping of files by name is best done by
tar(1) but the number of files is somewhat limited.
Finally if there are enough drives entire
disks can be copied using cp(1), or preferably with
dd(1) using the raw special files and an appropriate
block size.
<h2>
Converting Sixth Edition Filesystems
</h2>
<p>
The best way to convert file systems from 6th
edition (V6) to 7th edition (V7) format
is to use tar(1). However, a special version of tar must
be prepared
to run on V6.
The following steps will do this:
<dl>
<dt>1.<dd>
change directories to /usr/src/cmd/tar
<dt>2.<dd>
At the shell prompt respond
<dl><dt><dd>
make v6tar
<br>
</dl>
This will leave an executable binary named `v6tar'.
<dt>3.<dd>
Mount a scratch tape.
<dt>4.<dd>
Use tp(1) to put `v6tar' on the scratch
tape.
<dt>5.<dd>
Bring down V7 and bring up V6.
<dt>6.<dd>
Use tp (on V6) to read in `v6tar'. Put it in
/bin or /usr/bin (or perhaps some other preferred location).
<dt>7.<dd>
Use v6tar to make tapes of all that you wish to convert.
You may want to read the manual section on tar(1) to
see whether you want to use blocking or not.
Try to avoid using full pathnames when making the tapes. This
will simplify moving the hierarchy to some other place on 
V7 if desired. For example
<dl><dt><dd>
chdir /usr/ken
<br>
v6tar c .
<br>
</dl>
is preferable to
<dl><dt><dd>
v6tar c /usr/ken
<br>
</dl>
<dt>8.<dd>
After all of the desired tapes are made, bring
down V6 and reboot V7. Use
tar(1) to read in the tapes just made.
</dl>
<h2>
Odds and Ends
</h2>
<p>
The programs
dump,
icheck, quot, dcheck, ncheck, and df
(source in /usr/source/cmd)
should be changed to
reflect your default mounted file system devices.
Print the first few lines of these
programs and the changes will be obvious.
Tar should be changed to reflect your desired
default tape drive.
