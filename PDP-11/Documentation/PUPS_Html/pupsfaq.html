<P>
Welcome to the FAQ on the Unix Archive of PDP-11 Unix material, and how
to make use of it, either on a real PDP-11 or on an emulator. This FAQ doesn't
cover general Unix history or politics; you will have to go elsewhere for
that information.

<P>
If you have just obtained an Ancient UNIX license and want to run some old
versions, go straight to the section on <A HREF="pupsfaq.html#emulators">PDP-11 Emulators</A>.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>What is the copyright/ownership status of these old versions of Unix?</STRONG>
<DD>The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) own (at least): Unix research editions 1 to 7,
PWB/UNIX, Mini-UNIX, 32V, System III and System V. Those parts of 2.xBSD
which are derived from SCO's stuff is also copyright by SCO. Non-derived
parts of anything are owned by someone else (e.g the Regents of the University
of California for the BSD stuff).
<P>
None of the stuff owned by SCO is freely available, nor is it in the public
domain. You must still be covered by a Unix source license in order to have
legal access to this material. However, you can <A NAME="tex2html1"
 HREF="http://www.sco.com/offers/ancient.html">obtain
a UNIX source</A>
for free from SCO's
web site.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>What's in the Unix Archive?</STRONG>
<DD>5th, 6th and 7th Edition Unix. All versions of 2BSD, including 2.11BSD.
Some versions of 4BSD. 32V. System III for the PDP-11. Xinu. Venix.
Several PDP-11 emulators. Many tools which can work with old Unix disk
and tape formats. Lots of documentation and other useful information.
For more details, see the sections below on 
<A HREF="pupsfaq.html#pdp_versions">PDP-11 Versions of Unix</A> and
<A HREF="pupsfaq.html#emulators">PDP-11 Emulators.</A>

<P>
<DT><STRONG>How do I access the Unix Archive?</STRONG>
<DD><P>
You first need to obtain an <A NAME="tex2html2"
 HREF="http://www.sco.com/offers/ancient.html">Ancient UNIX license</A>
from SCO's web site. Once you
have clicked on the license, go to the bottom and follow the hyperlink
to obtain access to the Unix Archive.

<P>
After you fill in your details, you will be emailed the access details.
The go to the <A NAME="tex2html3"
 HREF="../TUHSarchive_sites.html">Unix Archive sites list</A>
to find your nearest mirror of the archive.

<P>
Once you have been granted access, you can also 
<A NAME="tex2html4"
 HREF="/cgi-bin/pups_req.cgi">order the Unix Archive</A>
on CD-ROM
or other media. This is done on a volunteer basis, so it may take some
time. Please volunteer to help out with this effort if you can.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>What happened to the early versions of Unix</STRONG>
<DD>The earliest complete system we have found is 6th Edition UNIX. 5th Edition
has its on-line manual pages missing. We have source code to a kernel
written in C from just before 4th Edition. We have two versions of the C
compiler from around 3rd Edition, and we have some application binaries
and application source from around 1st and 2nd Edition UNIX.

<P>
Fortunately, we do have paper copies of all the research editions of UNIX
from 1st to 7th Edition, and these will be scanned in and OCR'd.
We would be <B>extremely</B> pleased if anybody could unearth any of the first
four research editions of Unix, in <I>any</I> format. That includes printouts!

<P>
<DT><STRONG>I do have a PDP-11, can I use this old Unix software?</STRONG>
<DD><P>
Yes, depending on what type of hardware you own and once you have a source
license (see next section). Consult the sections on
<A HREF="pupsfaq.html#pdp_versions">PDP-11 Versions of Unix</A> and
<A HREF="pupsfaq.html#hardware">Hardware</A> to
determine what versions of Unix can run on your hardware.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>I don't have a PDP-11, can I still use this old Unix software?</STRONG>
<DD><P>
Yes, once you have a source license (see above). There are several
high-quality PDP-11 emulators which will run most
of the versions of Unix in the Unix Archive. Now you can read the Lions'
commentary <I>and</I> run the software. You still need a source license. See
the Section on <A HREF="pupsfaq.html#emulators">PDP-11 Emulators</A> for more details on the
available emulators.

Yes. If you have a Western Electric or AT&amp;T source license, please photocopy
the pages which give the license number, name of licensed institution, and
details of which versions of Unix are covered. Get the institution to draft
a letter affirming that you are an employee of the institution and are
covered by the source license. Then send the license details and the letter

Alternatively, obtain a free SCO source license as described in
the <A HREF="pupsfaq.html#intro">Introduction</A> to get automatic access to the archive.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>I've got the Lions' book, can you give me access to the
Unix Archive?</STRONG>
<DD><P>
No. The copyright on John Lions' commentary specifically states that:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
None of the computer software source code contained in this
	publication may be copied, distributed, modified, transferred
	or used in any way.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Therefore, you can only read the book, and nothing else. You must still
be covered by a Unix source license in order to get access to the archive.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Ok, where do I get a license from?</STRONG>
<DD>See the <A HREF="pupsfaq.html#intro">Introduction</A> for details on how to obtain a
free Unix source code from SCO.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>I have the SCO license, can I get 2.xBSD?</STRONG>
<DD><P>
Yes, they count as 16-bit ``successor systems''.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>I have the SCO license, can I get 4.xBSD?</STRONG>
<DD><P>
Yes. You need a 32V license to obtain 4.xBSD, and 32V is covered by the SCO
license. Kirk McKusick is now selling a 4CD set which contains all the BSD
releases from CSRG: 1BSD, 2.xBSD, 3BSD and 4.xBSD. See
<A NAME="tex2html5"
 HREF="http://www.mckusick.com/csrg/">Kirk's web site</A>
for more details.

<P>
Some of the 4.xBSD releases on Kirk's CD set are available in the Unix
Archive. We don't keep all of Kirk's CDs in the archive, because he put
so much effort into writing 4.xBSD and deserves some compensation. However,
if you need a specific 4.xBSD release, then please e-mail
<A NAME="tex2html6"
 HREF="mailto:wkt@cs.adfa.edu.au">Warren</A>
and he will
work something out for you.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>The SCO license mentions DESIGNATED CPUs? What gives?</STRONG>
<DD><P>
My contact at SCO says ``on SCO's request, you must furnish the list,
but we don't demand it up front.'' I can't wait for them to ask me, I've
only got emulators!

<DT><STRONG>What versions of Unix are in the archive?</STRONG>
<DD><P>
The PUPS archive contains full, bootable distributions of 5th, 6th and 7th
Edition Unix, 2.9BSD &amp; 2.11BSD, Mini-UNIX and 32V. Other versions of Unix in
the archive, but which are either not complete or not bootable are PWB/UNIX,
AUSAM, 2.79BSD, 2.8BSD and 2.10BSD. The archive contains some of the 4.xBSD
releases as well, Ultrix-11 and System III for the PDP-11. There is also
a copy of Xinu for the LSI 11/23: Xinu is not Unix, but it embodies many
of the ideas in Unix.
<P>
There are several distributions of `patches' to the above systems, such as
1BSD, 2BSD, V7-addenda and V7M. Finally, there are several modified versions
of Unix, such as the V6 with RL02 support from Tim Shoppa, and the heavily
modified V7 from Torsten Hippe.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>I have a PDP-11; which version of Unix do you recommend I run on it?</STRONG>
<DD><P>
<I>[Answered by: Warren Toomey wkt@cs.adfa.edu.au]</I>
<BR>
Firstly, you need to restrict the list of choices to those flavours of Unix
which will run on your PDP-11: see the next section on
<A HREF="pupsfaq.html#hardware">Hardware</A> for details on this. Assuming you have worked
that out, I would suggest the following:

<P>
Try to run 2.11BSD if possible, because it is the most modern flavour of
PDP-11 Unix, and it is being supported by Steven Schultz (in his spare time).
If you can't run 2.11BSD, then try 2.9BSD which is more modern than 7th
Edition.

<P>
If you have a historical bent, then you can run 5th, 6th or 7th Edition Unix.
These tend to be limited in the hardware that they support. I'd recommend that
you use one of the <A HREF="pupsfaq.html#emulators">PDP-11 emulators</A> for these systems,
as it will give you less heartache then trying to install it on a real -11,
and you probably will get frustrated by these old systems anyway.

You'll need to know this so as to work out what versions of Unix you can

<I>[Answered by: Warren Toomey wkt@cs.adfa.edu.au]</I> <BR>
I've only ever seen V5 distributed as RK05 disk images, and we don't have
the manuals so it's impossible to tell if it was distributed like this, as
tapes, or both. Dennis Ritchie says that V5 isn't too much different from V6,
and that most of the V6 manuals can be used for V5.

<P>
The V5 in the archive, from Dennis, expects an 11/40-style machine: 18-bit
addressing with kernel and user modes and EIS, and around 40Kw of memory. You
will need a line-frequency clock or a real-time clock (KW11-L). There is
support for 11/45-style machines with supervisor mode in sys/conf; however,
split I/D is actually used. Floating point is required to run
some programs; this is FP11-B only.

<P>
The V5 kernel as distributed supports the following devices (quoted from
the sources in sys/dmr):

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
DR11C, DC-11, DH-11, DM11-B, DN-11, DP-11, KL/DL-11, LP-11, PC-11, RS11,

RK03/05, rp, rk. I've got to grok the V5 mdec stuff a bit more to
complete this list.

It's likely that some of the device drivers in V6 could be backported to V5
with little difficulty.

I've only ever seen V6 distributed as disk images, although the manuals
describe how to load it from tape. It would be nice if someone recreated
the tape records.

<P>
As distributed, virgin V6 expects an 11/40-style machine: 18-bit addressing
with kernel and user modes and EIS, and around 96Kw of memory. You will need
a line-frequency clock or a real-time clock (KW11-L). There is support for
11/45-style machines with supervisor mode in sys/conf; split I/D is supported.
Floating point is required to run some programs:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
UNIX only supports the 11/45 FP11-B floating point
	unit. For machines without this hardware, there is a user
	subroutine available that will catch illegal instruction
	traps and interpret floating point operations. (See fptrap(3)).
	The system as delivered has this code included in all
	commands that have floating point. This code is never used
	if the FP hardware is available and therefore does not need
	to be changed. The penalty is a little bit of disk space
	and loading time for the few floating commands.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The V6 kernel as distributed supports the following devices (quoted from
the sources in sys/dmr):

<P>
The Boot_Images directory has an RL02 image of V6. I haven't have a look
at this yet, but it may contain kernel source for RL02 support.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>What hardware does Mini-UNIX support?</STRONG>
<DD><P>
<I>[Answered by: Warren Toomey wkt@cs.adfa.edu.au]</I> <BR>
This is very interesting. Mini-UNIX is a <I>very</I> cut-down 6th Edition
that appears to run on PDP-11s without memory management.
The documentation in Mini-UNIX says:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The MINI-UNIX system running is configured to run on an
11/10 with the given disk and the console teletype (KL)  and
using  the EIS (extended instruction set) software emulation
package. <TT>emul.s</TT> contains the software emulation package
to handle the extended instruction set, i.e. those instructions
which are not implemented in the PDP-11/20 and PDP-11/10 processor hardware.

<P>
MINI-UNIX  uses  12K  words of memory for the system and 16K
words for user programs.  Most  of  the  MINI-UNIX  software
will  run  with 12K words of memory, but some things require
much more.

<P>
MINI-UNIX only supports the 11/45 FP11-B floating point
unit.  For machines without this hardware, there is  a  user
subroutine  available  that  will  catch illegal instruction
traps and interpret floating point operations. 

<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>As well, the setup documentation describes the essential differences
between Mini-UNIX and 6th Edition:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are a number of differences between the capabilities
of MINI-UNIX and standard UNIX of which the user should
be aware.  The concept of ``groups'' is not supported in MINI-UNIX; 
no profiling is done in MINI-UNIX; it is not possible
to interactively debug another running process in MINI-UNIX.
User programs are limited to 16K words in size and the sharing
of text is not possible.  Pipes are not  implemented  in
the system; rather they are implemented as ``pseudo-pipes'' in
the Shell command.  Thus complex commands such as:

<P>
<PRE>
nm a.out | grep _c | pr -3
</PRE>
<P>
are still  possible.   However  the  commands  are  executed
sequentially,  saving  data  in  intermediate files.  The <TT>bc</TT>
command, in particular, works as in the standard UNIX system
but  cannot be used interactively since pipes are not implemented
in the system.  The source for the yacc compiler  has
been edited to change some table sizes to make it run in 16K
words of memory.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Apart from that, I haven't given this a really good look. At the moment,
the Unix Archive has Mini-UNIX on three RK05 disk images.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>What hardware does 7th Edition Unix support?</STRONG>

<I>[Answered by: Warren Toomey wkt@cs.adfa.edu.au]</I> <BR>
As distributed, virgin V7 expects an 11/45-style machine: 18-bit addressing
with kernel, supervisor, user modes, EIS, split I/D, and around 128Kw of
memory. You will need a line-frequency clock or a real-time clock (KW11-L).
There is support for 11/40-style machines without supervisor mode in sys/conf.
According to /usr/sys/40/README, V7 can be compiled to run ``on the 11/40,
11/60, and 11/23. It has, in fact, worked on the latter machine ... Support
is included for FP11-style floating point but I can't vouch for it.''
The V7 setup document has this to say about floating-point:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
UNIX only supports (and really expects to have) the
	FP11-B/C floating point unit. For machines without this
	hardware, there is a user subroutine available that will
	catch illegal instruction traps and interpret floating point
	operations. (See fptrap(3).) To install this subroutine in
	the library, change to /usr/src/libfpsim and execute the
	shell files compall and mklib.
	The system as delivered does not have this code included in
	any command, although the operating system adapts 
	automatically to the presence or absence of the FP11.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Henry Spencer says:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It was difficult to run V7 on a non-split-I/D machine.  Possible, yes, but
it required a severely cut-down kernel and was really only practical as a
single-user machine.  The bigger utilities (f77 is the example that comes
to mind) simply could not run that way.

<P>
Note that there was a bug in V7's long-divide library routines which was
largely invisible on pre-44 machines but made itself quite visible on the
44 and later CPUs. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The V7 kernel as distributed supports the following devices (quoted from
the sources in sys/dev):

<DT><STRONG>What hardware does 2.11BSD support?</STRONG>
<DD><P>
<I>[Answered by: Steven Schultz sms@moe.2bsd.com]</I> <BR>
The 2.11BSD system can be booted on a PDP-11
with 1Mb of memory or more (the kernel would probably only require a moderate 
amount of squeezing to fit on machines with less memory, but it would also 
be very unhappy about the prospect), separate I&amp;D, FP11B/C type of hardware
floating point, supervisor mode (if networking is to be used) and with any 
of the following disks:

<P>
RK06, RK07
<BR>
Any MSCP disk, including but not limited to: RD53, RD54, RA81, RZ2x (this also
includes SCSI disks attached to SCSI&lt;-&gt;MSCP adaptors such as the Emulex UC08
or CMD440)
<BR>
RM03, RM05, RM80
<BR>
RP04, RP05, RP06, RP07
<BR>
Many other SMD disks, for example: CDC 9766, Fuji 160, Fuji Eagle

<P>
Other disks are supported (RX23, RX33, RX50, RD51) but are not large
enough to hold a root filesystem plus a swap partition.  The old restriction
of using RL02 drives in pairs has been lifted.  It is now possible to define
a root (`a') partition and a swap partition (`b') and load at least the
root filesystem to a single RL02.
Discs which are too small to hold even a root filesystem (floppies for 
example)
may be used as data disks or as standalone boot media, but are not useable
for loading the distribution.  Others, while listed above, are not very
well suited to loading the distribution.  The RK06/07 drives are hard pressed
to even hold the system binaries, much less the sources.

<P>
The tape drives supported by this distribution are:

<P>
TS11, TU80, TK25
<BR>
TM11, AVIV 6250/1600
<BR>
TE16, TU45, TU77
<BR>
TK50, TU81, TU81+, TZ30
<BR>

<P>
4mm and 8mm SCSI tape drives are known to work when used with SCSI&lt;-&gt;TMSCP
adaptors.

<P>
QIC drives (such as the QIC-80, which use the DC2120 cartridges) are known
NOT to work.  Other SCSI tapes which correctly do `variable record mode'
should work.

<P>
Although 2.11BSD contains a kernel level floating point simulator, it has
never been tested.  In fact it would not even compile/assemble without
errors!  That problem has been fixed but it is still not known if the
simulator works. KDJ-11 based systems have builtin floating point so the
simulator can not be tested.  At the release of 2.10BSD some thought was given
to the possibility of lifting the separate I&amp;D restriction, but that
thought has languished.  The work will
never be done.  As time passes more and more programs have
become almost too large even with separate I&amp;D.

<P>
2.11BSD is known to work on the 11/44, 11/70, 11/73, 11/83, 11/84, 11/93.  It
should work on the 11/53 but this has not (that I know of) been tested.  The 
11/94 is a faster 11/84 and should also work fine.  The 11/23,24,34,35,40,60 
are NOT supported becuase they lack separate I/D capability.  While the 11/45 
does have separate I/D (and supervisor space) the 45 can not run 2.11BSD due 
to lack of memory (248kb maximum on the 11/45 and that is far too little).

<I>[Answered by: Warren Toomey wkt@cs.adfa.edu.au]</I> <BR>
At worst, you will have to write kernel device drivers and possibly bootstrap
code to get Unix to use your hardware. However, you might want to look through
the archive for other flavours of Unix (such as 2.9BSD and 2.11BSD), and
even the modified versions of Unix (e.g the V7 modifications from Torsten
Hippe) for appropriate device drivers. You may have to `port' code from one
flavour of Unix to the one you wish to use.

<P>
If you are going to embark on this process, and you can't get Unix onto your
PDP-11 `as is', I'd suggest you use the PDP-11 emulators plus your desired
Unix flavour as a development environment to build Unix kernels and disk
images with your source code modifications.

<P>
At best, the flavour of Unix you want already supports your hardware; the
distribution kernel just hasn't had the code compiled in. Again, use the
PDP-11 emulators plus your desired Unix flavour as a development environment
to build a Unix kernel appropriate for your hardware. Then all you have to
do is install the distribution plus the new kernel onto your hardware.

<A NAME="tex2html9"
 HREF="ftp://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/pub/PDP-11/Sims">ftp://minnie.cs.adfa.edu.au/pub/PDP-11/Sims</A>. One runs under MS-DOS, and
the others run under 32-bit Unix.
<P>
<DT><STRONG>Which emulator do you recommend?</STRONG>
<DD><I>[Answered by: Warren Toomey wkt@cs.adfa.edu.au]</I> <BR>
That depends on why you need an emulator. If all you want to do is to
play with these old Unixes, then nearly any of the emulators will be fine.
However, if you are going to be using it as a development environment, then
each emulator has its own particular advantage. Here's a summary from my
own experience.

<P>
John Wilson's Ersatz emulator is the fastest emulator, and it can emulate
a number of different CPU types. It also has the largest range of emulated
devices. It runs under MS-DOS though, and you need a license from John if
you want to use it for commercial work. If you want speed, use this one.

<P>
If you require an emulator which runs under 32-bit Unix, then I would
recommend Bob Supnik's emulator, as it is fast and configurable. However,
it only gives you one terminal device (the console). If you need multiple
logins, then try Begemot from Joerg Micheel &amp; Harti Brandt. It's more
cumbersome than Bob Supnik's emulator, but you can telnet in to the emulator.

<P>
The above programs emulate the whole box, and are great for working with
or creating disk images and tape images. However, it's hard to import/export
individual files: I normally build tar images outside the emulator, and
then <TT>tar vxf /dev/mt0</TT> inside the emulator.

<P>
Another solution is to just emulate the PDP-11 user-mode, and to get the
real underlying operating system to perform the system calls. The Apout
emulator works this way. You can edit a file (using your normal tools) in one
xterm window, and then compile it inside the emulator in another xterm window.
I use this emulator for building new Unix kernels. The main drawbacks of
Apout is that it only runs V6 and V7 binaries, and there is no floating
point support.

<P>
<DT><STRONG>Where can I get disk images for the emulators?</STRONG>
<DD>The directory <TT>Boot_Images</TT> in the Unix Archive contains disk images for
several versions of PDP-11 Unix. Read the documentation in there to work out
how to boot each disk image on the emulators.

<P>
If you are using the Apout emulator, just unpack the binaries from the
appropriate version(s) of Unix in the <TT>Distributions</TT> directories
in the Unix Archive.

Excellent! What you need to do is to get one of the PUPS volunteers to
cut you a tape with a Unix installation on it and send it to you. Then
you can use the standard installation instructions to load the system.
<P>
If you have the archive CD-ROM, you might even be able to create your
own tape image (via one of the emulators), write the image to a real tape,
and then load it as above. Let us know how you go so we can update this FAQ.

<P>
Note that, currently, 5th and 6th Edition are not in a state which can be
loaded via tape. It might be possible to rectify this for V6, but no one
has tried it, and you might like to volunteer!

<P>
<DT><STRONG>How do I install the XXX flavour of Unix on my PDP-11? I don't have a tape

<DD><P>
This is more difficult. If you have removable disk media, you might be able to
convince one of the PUPS volunteers to write a distribution onto the disk
pack, and ship it back to you. This might cost $$$ for postage.

<P>
If you have RT-11, see the answer to the next question.

<P>
One solution here is to pull the installation over via serial line. You're
going to need a lot of patience. In Tools/Tapes/Vtserver in the archive
you will find a program which installs 7th Edition Unix over a serial line
from a nearby 32-bit Unix box. This hasn't been ported to V5, V6 or 2.xBSD.
Again, any help we can get here would be appreciated.

<P>
Finally, if you have any other ideas or working solutions to solve this
problem, please let us know!

<P>
<DT><STRONG>How do I install the XXX flavour of Unix on my PDP-11? I'm currently

<DD><P>
You can use the KSERVE program under RT-11, which is a
cut-down Kermit client, to pull a disk image over a serial line. You will
need a Kermit server at the other end, but any PC or Unix box will do here.
You can obtain KSERVE in source form at

Try the Usenet newsgroup <TT>vmsnet.pdp-11</TT> first: there are a lot of

<DT><STRONG>I'm having a Unix software problem with my PDP-11. Where can I get help?</STRONG>

Read the manuals on your version of Unix. Look through the PUPS archive
(especially the Documentation section and the mail archive) for answers.
Ask the PUPS mailing list, which is for people interested in these old
versions of Unix: make sure you give as much detail as possible. Finally,
you can try the Usenet newsgroup <TT>vmsnet.pdp-11</TT>, but the readers there
tend to be more into RT-11 and RSX.
