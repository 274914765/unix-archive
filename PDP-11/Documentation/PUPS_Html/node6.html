<A NAME="hwsupportindex">&#160;</A>
I am currently building up a list of PDP Unix versions, and what hardware
they support. Here is the list so far.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00061000000000000000">Fifth Edition Unix and Mini-Unix</A></H2>
<P>
The versions of Fifth Edition Unix and Mini-Unix in the PUPS archive
are in the form of bootable RK05 disk images. I have booted both of these
on an 11/40, and they should also boot on an 11/45. Both are very similar
to Sixth Edition, and so you should read the next section for hardware that
is likely to be supported by these versions.
<P>
<h2>Comments from Henry Spencer</h2>

In an email, Henry Spencer writes:

<blockquote>
V6 ought to boot just fine on a 34 with the full (calculator-style) front
console.  In general, a 34 looks so much like a 40 to the software that it
was almost impossible to tell the difference, with the single exception
that some variants of the 34 lacked a full front console and consequently
would bus-error if the front-console-switches register was accessed. 
(Later 11s with limited consoles, like the 44, played it smart by still
having the register!)  Alas, V6 <tt>init</tt> used the <tt>getcsw()</tt>
system call to decide whether to come up single-user, so a limited-console 34
probably won't boot V6 without modifications. The same comments apply to the 23.
<p>
V7 as shipped definitely will <b>not</b> boot on a 40 or 34.  There are
provisions for building a 40 version, but the boot image definitely
assumes a 45 or 70.  (Also, a 40 version has to be severely cut down,
and won't support very much activity before running out of table space.)
<p>
Incidentally, a side effect of this is that V7 won't quite boot on a 44 -
to the software, a 44 is almost indistinguishable from a 70 with Unibus
disks, but V7 assumes 70s are Massbus systems and their disks don't need
the Unibus map... so it won't boot on a 22-bit-address system with Unibus
disks.  The quick fix is to patch the software so it thinks it's running
on a 45 and doesn't turn on 22-bit addressing; the better fix is to alter
the startup code to initialize the Unibus map.

<P>
The `Setting Up Unix - Sixth Edition' guide says that the distribution
tape is configure to be able to boot on a PDP 11/40 with either an RK05,
RP03 or RP04 disk, TU10 magtape or TU56 DECtape.
<P>
I have no idea as to whether Sixth Edition can be booted on smaller PDPs
(11/34 etc). It can be reconfigured to run on an 11/45 and an 11/70.
<P>
The `Setting Up Unix' guide lists the following devices which can be
configured:
<P>
<UL><LI> PC11, LP11, RS11<LI> RS03/RS04<LI> RK03/RK05<LI> TU10,TU56, TU16<LI> RP03, RP04<LI> KL11/DL11-ABC, DL11-E<LI> DC11, DP11, DN11<LI> DH11, DM11-BB

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The distribution tape can be used only on a DEC PDP11/45 or PDP11/70 with RP03,
RP04, RP05, RP06 disks and with a TU10, TU16, or TE16 tape drive.

<P>
I have no idea as to whether Seventh Edition can be booted on smaller PDPs
(11/34 etc). It should be able to boot on an 11/70.

<P>
The PUPS archive contains bootable Seventh Edition disk images for RK05s
and RL02s, tailored for a PDP 11/40.

Other tape/disk controllers and drives may be easily usable with the system,
but might require minor modifications to the system
to allow bootstrapping.
The controllers and the drives shown here are known
to work as bootstrap devices.

<BLOCKQUOTE> This distribution can be booted on a PDP-11
with 1Mb of memory or more,
separate I&amp;D, and with any of the following disks:
<P>
<UL><LI> RK06, RK07<LI> Any MSCP disk, including but not limited to: RD53, RD54, RA81, RZ2x<LI> RM03, RM05<LI> RP04, RP05, RP06<LI> Many other SMD disks, for example: CDC 9766, Fuji 160, Fuji Eagle
</UL>
<P>
Other disks are supported (RX23, RX33, RX50, RD51) but are not large
enough to hold a root filesystem plus a swap partition.  The old restriction
of using RL02 drives in pairs has been lifted.  It is now possible to define
a root ('a') partition and a swap partition ('b') and load at least the
root filesystem to a single RL02.
Discs which are too small to hold even a root filesystem (floppies for 
example)
may be used as data disks or as standalone boot media, but are not useable
for loading the distribution. Others, while listed above, are not very
well suited to loading the distribution.  The RK06/07 drives are hard pressed
to even hold the system binaries, much less the sources.
<P>
The tape drives supported by this distribution are:
