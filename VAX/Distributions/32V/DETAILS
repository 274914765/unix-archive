32V Tape
--------

Although 32V isn't strictly a PDP-11 UNIX system, it is a very close
derivative of 7th Edition, so I thought it would be ok to archive it.

The tape comes from Keith Bostic, and is composed of three images,
file1, file2 and a tarball now called 32v_usr.tar. I assume that
all three were originally three separate records on a tape.

The information from Keith says:

	Block size for file1 is 512, block size for file2 is 10240.
	The first label on the tape:

		BELL LABORATORIES INC
		UNIX/32V* TIME-SHARING SYSTEM, VERSION 1.0
		9 TRACK 800 BPI 3 FILES FILE1=232 RECORDS
		FILE 2=480 RECORDS FILE 3=1202 RECORDS
		*UNIX IS A TRADEMARK OF BELL LABORATORIES
		(2/22/80 written in pencil)

	The second label on the tape:

		RESTRICTED RIGHTS
		USE, DUPLICATION OR DISCLOSURE IS
		SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS STATED IN
		YOUR CONTRACT WITH WESTERN ELECTRIC
		COMPANY, INC

I haven't looked at file1 yet; I assume it's a set of bootstrap
records. file2 is a 32V root filesystem, and a tar equivalent
(minus some /dev/entries) is in file2.tar.gz. A list of what is in
/dev/ in dev_files.
