Here are some interesting bits of folklore about PDP Unix. I do have some
bits from old AUUGNs which I haven't scanned in yet, but I don't have
any editions before Vol. 5. Does anybody else have any anecdotes?
<P>

In the Annals of the History of Computing, Volume 12, Number 4, 1990, p.264,
it was stated that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> An oral history project to document the development of the Unix system
  has been initiated by AT&amp;T Bell laboratories, the birthplace of
  Unix.  The year-long project will include interviews with such Unix
  pioneers as Dennis Richie, Ken Thompson, and Doug McIlroy.  The first
  cassette, titled &quot;Release 0, the Beginning&quot;, is available by
  contacting Michael E. Miller, AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, Room 1L-414, JFK
  Parkway, Short Hills, NJ, USA, 07078.

<P>
In January 1994, Russell Schulz received a paper letter from AT&amp;T which
said (in part):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The AT&amp;T Corporate Archives is in the process of transcribing and
  editing the tapes on the UNIX Project.  The transcriptions are halfway
  finished and need to be approved by the interviewees and corrected.
  This process should be completed in approximately six months.  At
  that time, a decision will be made as to how these transcriptions
  will be used.
