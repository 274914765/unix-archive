       _C_p?   retrieves the named _s_o_u_r_c_e_f_i_l_e from a UNIX file sys-
       tem.  If a _t_a_r_g_e_t_f_i_l_e is specified,  the  copy  is  placed
       there;  otherwise  the contents of the file are written to
       standard output.  If the _t_a_r_g_e_t_f_i_l_e named is a  directory,
       the  file  is  copied  there with the same basename as the
       original.

       _L_s?  is similar to _c_p?  (in fact, it is merely a  link  to
       it),  but  lists the contents of the directory _s_o_u_r_c_e_f_i_l_e;
       if the file is not a directory, it is  listed  by  itself.
       Normally,  just  filenames  are  listed; if the --ll flag is
       given, more information (protection, modes) is printed.

       Other options recognized by both _c_p_?  and _l_s_?:


       --dd device Filesystem  resides  on  the  named  _d_e_v_i_c_e  (or
                 file), rather than the default.

       --vv        Filesystem is a VAX (32V) filesystem.

       --77        Filesystem is a version 7 filesystem.

       --66        Filesystem is a version 6 filesystem.

       Most are self-explanatory.

       "File has hole(s)" means that the file contains an unallo-
       cated block.  This usually indicates something weird  with
       the  file,  but  may  be a normal condition.  Holes in the
       output file are created as allocated  blocks  filled  with
       zeros.

HHEEPP IINNFFOO
       Written  at  HEP  by  Rob Pike.  Modified by Mark Bartelt.
       Further hacked by Norman Wilson.   Hacked  still  more  by
       Mark Bartelt.

       On  the  UNIX VAX, the program is named _c_p_1_1 and _l_s_1_1, and
       is used to fetch files  from  the  PDP-11/45  RJE  system.
       Since the RJE system is now running a V7 system, --77 is the
       default.

       On the 11/45, the program is named _c_p_v  and  _l_s_v,  and  is
       used to fetch files from the VAX.  The default is --vv.

       Now  also  runs  under  VMS (ported via EUNICE), where the
       disks containing UNIX filesystems are mounted foreign with
       names $UNIX0, $UNIX1, and so forth.  The following foreign
       commands are defined:
            cpu*nix :== $sys$sysdisk:[bin]getunix cpunix
            lsu*nix :== $sys$sysdisk:[bin]getunix lsunix
            cpv*ax :== $sys$sysdisk:[bin]getunix cpvax
            lsv*ax :== $sys$sysdisk:[bin]getunix lsvax
            cp11 :== $sys$sysdisk:[bin]getunix cp11
            ls11 :== $sys$sysdisk:[bin]getunix ls11

       On the VMS VAX, _c_p_u_/_l_s_u (and _c_p_v_/_l_s_v) are  used  to  fetch
       files from the UNIX VAX, _c_p_1_1_/_l_s_1_1 to fetch files from the
       11/45.  Defaults are, obviously, --vv and --77,  respectively.

       File  protection modes are checked to ensure that the per-
       son running the program actually  has  appropriate  access
       permission.   When  running  under VMS, the access test is
       modified somewhat: Since there is no convenient way to map
       UNIX UIDs and VMS UIC member numbers onto each other, only
       group and world access are checked.  Furthermore, a  group
       match is defined to exist if the decimal representation of
       the UNIX GID is the same as the  octal  representation  of
       the  VMS  UIC  group  number.  This is done to make things
       easier for people who set up accounts: If a group  on  the
       VMS  machine is, say, 123 (octal), that same group must be
       123 (decimal) on the UNIX machines, and vice-versa.   For-
       tunately,  that's  the  way  things are set up here.  Note
       that files which are readable  only  to  owner  cannot  be
       copied to the VMS system.

       The  UNIX  version needs to read ``cooked'' devices rather
       than ``raw'' ones, since it does _l_s_e_e_ks that aren't whole-
       block multiples.

       The VMS version of _l_s?  does not produce sorted output.
