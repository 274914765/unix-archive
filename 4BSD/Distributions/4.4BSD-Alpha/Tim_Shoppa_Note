Note: these files were read from 9-track, and as per the following note,
the 2nd and 3rd "raw tape files" are themselves already compressed.  file01 is
4080 records of 1024 bytes each, file02 is 1610 records of 20480
bytes each (except for the last one which is 4329 bytes), and file03
is 2677 records of 20480 bytes each (except for the last one which
is 14435 bytes).  Note that the suggested 'dd' command in the
letter below uses a blocksize of 10240 bytes.  Tim.

Letter attached to tape:

						August 23, 1992 

	This is a distribution tape for the 4.4BSD-Alpha release.
The package you received should have contained one 2400' 6250 BPI 9-track
magnetic tape or one Exabyte 8mm cassette.  Both distribution tapes
contain three files, however, the second and third files on the 9-track
distribution format are compressed (see compress(1)).  The three files are
as follows:

  1) A dump(8) of the root file system
  2) A tar format archive of the "/usr" file system
  3) A tar format archive of the "/usr/src" file system.

	The binaries and kernel on the tape support the Hewlett-Packard
9000/300 68000-based workstations, as detailed on the next page.  The dump
does not contain a kernel, however, a compiled, generic kernel is part of the
third file, in "/usr/src/sys/compile/GENERIC.hp300/vmunix".  The
tar format archives can be extracted into the current directory with a
command such as:

  tar xpf /dev/tapename

or, for the 9-track distribution format, with a command such as:

  dd if=/dev/tapename bs-10240 | uncompress | tar xf -
